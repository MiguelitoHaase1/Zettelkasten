# Week 1 Topics

Date:: [[2025-07-30]]
Context:: First week priorities aligned with [[100 day plan at Jabra]]
Goal:: Begin hypothesis testing, stakeholder alignment, and team inspiration

## Key Hypotheses and Assumptions to Test

### Organizational Structure
- **[[Assumption - Current PM Team Lacks Product Ownership]]** - Are PMs coordinators or owners?
  - *Test*: Interview PMs about decision authority and accountability
  - *Measure*: Map actual vs desired responsibilities

### Team Capabilities  
- **[[Hypothesis - Poland Dev Team Empowerment]]** - Can [[Software Development Center]] handle more product decisions?
  - *Test*: Assess current customer exposure and product context
  - *Measure*: Team readiness for direct customer access

### Strategic Innovation
- **[[Hypothesis - Front-line AI Skunk Works]]** - Should we create independent team for [[Front-line Workers]] AI device?
  - *Test*: Assess organizational readiness for [[Skunk Works]] approach
  - *Measure*: Executive support and resource availability

## Key Questions to Ask

### Customer Access
- "When's your next customer meeting I can join?"
- "What (potential) customer feedback channels exist that I should tap into?"

### Team Dynamics
- "How connected do you feel to software developers in the team?"
- "Who are the most innovative people on our teams?"

### Organizational Constraints
- "Which [[SAFe]] rituals add the most vs least value?"
- "What would you do differently if you had full authority?"

### Strategic Direction
- "Where do we waste the most effort on [[Feature Parity Trap|feature parity]]?"
- "What would a breakthrough product look like?"

## Key Problems to Solve

### Expand Product Team Scope
**Goal**: Make people push the boundaries of [[SAFe]] framework

**Tactics**:
- Challenge team boundaries: "What if a person in product team owned end-to-end customer experience?"


### Create "Uncomfortably Excited" Feeling
**Goal**: Generate "this is great... but not sure I'm good enough for it" response

**Approach**:
- **Elevate expectations**: Paint vision of product excellence that stretches current abilities

**Specific Tactics**:
- Create opportunities for bigger impact and visibility - what if we merged PO and PM, and made you a real PM/CEO of product?


### Week 1 Success Metrics
- [ ] At least 1 customer touchpoints scheduled or completed
- [ ] 1 PM/PO pair identified for role consolidation pilot
- [ ] [[Poland]] team assessment scheduled
- [ ] 3+ people expressing excitement (and some uncomfort) about expanded responsibilities
- [ ] Started a list of [[SAFe]] constraints to challenge

## Appendix - questions I'd love to ask procurement people fo r [[Videoconferencing]]
### 1. Feature Parity vs. Unique Value Question

  "Tell me about the **last time you chose a vendor that had fewer features** than the competition - what made that decision 
  worthwhile?"

  Why this matters: Tests whether [[IT Sourcers]] actually make decisions based on feature checklists or if unique value can
  overcome feature gaps. Your [[Hypothesis - Feature Parity Trap]] assumes customers choose products for unique value, not feature
   checklists.

### 2. Procurement vs. User Needs Question

  "When your **[[IT Admins]] complain about a tool not working the way they need it to, but that tool met all the requirements** in your original procurement process - what happens next?"

  Why this matters: Reveals the gap between procurement criteria and actual user needs. Your customer research shows [[IT Admins]]
   are often "excluded from purchase decisions despite being primary users" - this tests whether procurement-focused features
  matter more than user experience.

### 3. Risk vs. Innovation Balance Question

  "Describe a time when you **took a chance on a vendor's unique capability** rather than going with the 'safe' established player - what convinced you to take that risk?"

  Why this matters: Tests the [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] forces - specifically how "pull toward new solution" can overcome
  "anxiety about new solution." This reveals whether your differentiated [[Edge AI]] or [[Meeting Equity]] capabilities could
  actually win against safer feature-parity approaches.
