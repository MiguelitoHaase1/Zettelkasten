# Week of 4th August 2025: Mapping Power and Building Coalitions

## Purpose This Week
You've identified the core problems - [[Software as an afterthought]], lack of [[We need true Product Leaders|true product leaders]], and organizational inertia. This week, you'll map who actually has the power to change things and prepare a compelling deck to win them over. By Friday, you'll know exactly who can unlock change and have a story that motivates them to act.

## The One Key Problem to Solve
**Identify and map the real power brokers in Jabra, and have a deck ready describing your key hypotheses to them**

Success looks like: Power broker map with influence levels + 10-slide deck tailored to their motivations, ready for next week's meetings.

Key hypotheses to share are [[Software as an afterthought]], [[The Feature Parity Trap]], [[We need less 'cold hands']], [[We need true Product Leaders]].

## Key Questions to Ask Everyone
1. "Tell me about a time a big product change happened - who drove it and who had to say yes?"
2. "Who are the unofficial leaders that people actually follow, regardless of title?"
3. "Where is the feature parity chase most costly and speed reducing in [[Videoconferencing]]?"
4. "When's your next customer/user meeting I can join?"
5. "In one sentence, how would you describe the job of a product manager?"

## Five Other Potential Focus Areas for the Week

### 1. Map the Power Network
**Hypothesis/Problem**: Real power doesn't follow the org chart - need to find hidden influencers
**Action**: Create visual map showing formal authority vs actual influence, identify top 10 power brokers
**Key People**: [[Nisse]], your manager, long-tenured employees who've "seen it all"

### 2. How to avoid the feature parity trap?
**Problem**: Currently, we are in a feature parity chase in [[Videoconferencing]]... we will never win that way, and have to change the narrative
**Action**: Go deep with [[John Hand]] on understanding the feature parity plan, and describe the cracks and opportunies. Get super tactical and propose that tio Anders
**Key People**: [[John Hand]], [[Anders]],[[Ollie]],...

### 3. Build the Case for Product Leadership
**Hypothesis**: PMs lack real agency - display clearly how much we lose from not having that
**Action**: Document 3 specific examples where lack of PM authority led to product failures/delays
**Key People**: [[Anders]], [[Rajat]], frustrated PMs,...

### 4. Design Skunk Works Operating Model
**Problem**: Need concrete "rules" that protect [[Front-line AI Skunk Works]] from organizational antibodies
**Action**: Draft 1-page "Skunk Works Charter" with 5-7 non-negotiable operating principles
**Key People**: [[Anders]], Ovais, Alex, anyone who's tried (and failed) to innovate - Jabra Engage?

### 5. Create the Hypothesis Deck
**Problem**: Need compelling story that connects problems → hypotheses → pilot programs → outcomes for [[Software as an afterthought]], [[The Feature Parity Trap]], [[We need less 'cold hands']], [[We need true Product Leaders]].
**Action**: Build 10-slide deck: problem evidence (3), key hypotheses (3), pilot proposals (3), success vision (1)
**Key People**: [Anders] first - possible [Rajat]

## Success Metrics by Friday
- [ ] Power broker map identifying 5+ key influencers with their motivations
- [ ] Describe the feature parity trap in detail, and align a way forward with John Hand and Anders
- [ ] 3 concrete PM authority failure examples documented
- [ ] Skunk Works Charter with 5-7 operating principles drafted
- [ ] 10-slide hypothesis deck reviewed and ready for power broker meetings

## Remember
Power brokers respond to what helps THEM win - frame every hypothesis through their lens, not yours.
