# VP Product Non-Negotiables for Jabra

## 6-Month Timeline for Organizational Change

### Context

As VP of Product at Jabra, I’ve identified critical systemic issues that must be addressed within 6 months for me to remain in this role. These non-negotiables address the fundamental dysfunction in our current approach to software development, which is optimized for hardware timelines but catastrophically misaligned with software realities.

-----

## 1. Skunk Works Team Operational

**Requirement:** At least one fully operational Skunk Works team proving an alternative to SAFe

**Why this matters:**

- Current SAFe implementation is failing to deliver predictability despite that being its core promise
- Software needs 1-3 month cycles, not the 24-48 month hardware cycles NEIW was designed for
- Need to demonstrate that empowered, small teams can outperform our current bureaucratic approach
- Must prove there’s a better way before we can scale transformation

**Success criteria:**

- Team is autonomous and delivering working software
- Clear metrics showing improved velocity and quality vs SAFe teams
- Documented learnings to inform broader transformation

-----

## 2. NIEW Framework: Outcome-Based Implementation

**Requirement:** NIW framework focused exclusively on outcomes and jobs-to-be-done, not individual features

**Current dysfunction:**

- Business requirements are disconnected from software reality
- PMs push features while teams struggle with tech debt
- No clear compelling vision behind products
- Transactional relationships between business and product teams

**New approach:**

- Prioritize jobs-to-be-done over feature requests
- Outcome-based metrics and OKRs
- Strategic themes set by product management
- Reality-check roadmaps through PI goal stability over time

**Success criteria:**

- All new initiatives defined as outcomes, not features
- Clear OKRs driving decision-making
- Measurable improvement in product-business alignment

-----

## 3. Product Managers Drive Framework Independence

**Requirement:** Product managers and epic owners independently run NIEW framework without my constant involvement

**Current problem:**

- Too much senior management involvement in detailed decisions
- Lack of agency at individual contributor level
- Paternalistic culture where people fear making judgment calls
- Leaders doing detail work instead of strategic leadership

**Solution:**

- Empower PMs to make tactical decisions within strategic boundaries
- Create “no-fly zones” where managers don’t engage
- Build conviction in teams through clear vision and autonomy
- Move from synchronous alignment to asynchronous updates

**Success criteria:**

- PMs running framework meetings independently
- Reduced escalations to VP level
- Increased team confidence in decision-making

-----

## 4. Digital Transformation Program openly communicated

**Requirement:** Launched public transformation program acknowledging core problems with R&D leadership (particularly Christophe) communication

**Why public commitment:**

- Current symptoms indicate non-functional system (90% waste in meetings, lack of agency, unclear vision)
- Need organizational commitment to change, not just process tweaks
- Transparency builds trust and accountability
- External commitment creates urgency and prevents backsliding

**Program must address:**

- Systematic waste in current rituals
- Lack of individual agency
- Disconnect between business and software reality
- Team topology problems (116 people across 40+ products)
- Slow cadence incompatible with software development

**Success criteria:**

- Program publicly announced with clear timeline
- R&D leadership actively communicating changes
- Regular transparent updates on transformation progress

-----

## 5. Fundamental SAFe Role Changes

**Requirement:** Measurable improvements in SAFe framework through role restructuring

**Specific changes:**

- Combine Product Manager and Product Owner roles for better alignment
- Shift power from Release Train Engineers to Tech Leads
- Reduce bureaucratic overhead in favor of technical leadership
- Streamline rituals to eliminate 90% waste in meetings

**Rationale:**

- Current division between “Product Management VERSUS product teams” is dysfunctional
- Too much process, not enough empowerment
- Need technical leaders driving technical decisions
- Must maintain SAFe’s cadence benefits while eliminating bureaucracy

**Success criteria:**

- New role definitions implemented and functioning
- Measurable improvement in meeting effectiveness
- Reduced time-to-delivery for software initiatives
- Improved product-engineering trust and collaboration

-----

## 6. Time Allocation: Maximum 5 Hours Weekly in Rituals

**Requirement:** Limit my participation in SAFe and NIW ritual meetings to maximum 5 hours per week

**Current dysfunction:**

- 90% of ritual conversations irrelevant to 90% of participants
- Everything aligned through meetings instead of asynchronous documentation
- Senior managers pulled into tactical details
- Cognitive overload on leaders and team members

**New model:**

- Write-it-down culture for status updates
- Synchronous time reserved for problem-solving only
- Compressed cycles (6 weeks instead of quarterly)
- Fewer stakeholders in each cycle

**Success criteria:**

- Calendar audit showing <5 hours weekly in framework rituals
- Increased strategic thinking time
- Better written documentation and async communication
- Teams functioning independently

-----

## Transformation Philosophy

These non-negotiables are based on key transformation principles:

- **Move slow to move fast:** Build the right foundation for sustained speed
- **Path-aware decisions:** Early architecture and vision choices have lasting impact
- **Compress cycles:** From quarterly to 6-weekly iterations
- **Create no-fly zones:** Protected domains for team autonomy
- **Write it down:** Asynchronous communication as default
- **Not one size fits all:** Multiple approaches for different problem types

-----

## Timeline: 6 Months to Demonstrate Progress

Each non-negotiable must show measurable progress within 6 months. This is not about perfection but about clear directional change and commitment to a better way of working.

**If these changes are not initiated and showing progress by February 2026, I will consider this role incompatible with my principles and effectiveness as a product leader.**
