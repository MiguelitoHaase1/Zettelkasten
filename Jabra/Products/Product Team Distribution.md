# Product Team Distribution

## Current Allocation

How Jabra's ~10 software teams are distributed across product areas within [[SWART Structure]]:

### Device Management (3 teams)
- Owner: [[John Hand]]
- Product: [[Jabra+]]
- Focus: IT admin tools, remote management
- 30% of team capacity

### End User (2 teams)
- Owner: [[Mikkel]]
- Products: [[Jabra Mobile]], [[Jabra Sound+]], [[Jabra Direct]]
- Focus: Consumer applications
- 20% of team capacity

### Partner Facing (3 teams)
- Owner: [[Nisse]]
- Products: [[Developer Platform]], APIs, SDKs
- Focus: Integration and partnerships
- 30% of team capacity

### Platforms (2 teams)
- Owner: **None assigned** ⚠️
- Focus: Shared services, infrastructure
- 20% of team capacity
- Critical gap in ownership

## Key Observations

### Imbalances
- Platform teams lack PM leadership
- Device management may be over-resourced
- End user seems under-resourced given product count

### Missing Areas
- No dedicated teams for:
  - [[GenAI Devices]] (under [[Ovais]])
  - [[Jabra Engage AI]] 
  - Video conferencing software
  - Emerging opportunities

### Team Size Issues
- [[John Gould]]: "1-person team" for Developer Programme
- Some PMs managing multiple products
- Others focused on single product

## Strategic Implications

1. **Platform Gap** - No PM for platform teams creates risk
2. **Resource Mismatch** - Team allocation doesn't match strategic priorities
3. **Scaling Issues** - Structure won't support growth areas
4. **Coordination Overhead** - Too many teams in one ART

## Recommendations

Per [[Transform Away from SAFe]]:
- Break into multiple smaller ARTs
- Align teams to business domains
- Add PM for platform teams
- Rebalance based on strategic priorities
