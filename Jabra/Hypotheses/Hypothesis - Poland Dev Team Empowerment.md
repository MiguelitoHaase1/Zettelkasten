# Hypothesis: Poland Dev Team Empowerment

Statement:: If we give the [[Software Development Center]] in Poland more product decision-making authority and direct customer access, then we'll improve both product quality and team engagement while reducing coordination overhead

Confidence:: Medium-High - 75%
Based on:: [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]], [[100 day plan at Jabra]] emphasis on getting developers in front of customers/users/partners
Testing via:: 
- Pilot giving Poland team direct customer feedback channels
- Measure code quality, feature completion rates, and team satisfaction
- Track reduction in back-and-forth communication cycles

Status:: #hypothesis/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- Developers closest to technical constraints often have best solutions
- [[100 day plan at Jabra]] calls for "Get developers, designers, and product managers consistently in front of customers/users/partners"
- Distributed teams work better with autonomy than heavy coordination
- [[Software Development Center]] likely has strong technical talent being underutilized for product decisions

## Evidence Against
- Risk of technical solutions not aligned with business strategy
- Potential for inconsistent user experience across products
- May require significant upskilling in customer research/business context
- Could create friction with existing PM/PO roles

## Impact if Wrong
- Could lead to technically excellent but commercially poor products
- Might create conflicts between Poland team and product management
- Risk of duplicated efforts or misaligned priorities

## Testing Approach
1. Select 2-3 features for Poland-led development with direct customer access
2. Provide customer research training and direct feedback channels
3. Give decision authority for technical implementation and UX within defined constraints
4. Compare outcomes vs traditional PM-driven development
5. Measure team engagement and product success metrics

## Success Metrics
- Feature completion rate improvement >25%
- Reduced development cycle time
- Higher Poland team engagement scores
- Maintained or improved customer satisfaction
- Fewer requirement clarification cycles

## Prerequisites for Success
- Clear business context and constraints communication
- Customer research skills training for key Poland team members
- Direct feedback channels (customer calls, usage data access)
- Authority boundaries clearly defined
