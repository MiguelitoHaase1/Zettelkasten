# Hypothesis: Front-line AI Skunk Works

Statement:: If we create an independent [[Skunk Works]] team to develop AI-powered devices for [[Front-line Workers]], then we'll accelerate innovation and avoid organizational constraints that slow breakthrough product development

Confidence:: Medium - 70%
Based on:: [[Hypothesis - Front-line Workers Bigger Than Video]], need for rapid innovation in emerging AI market
Testing via:: 
- Assess organizational readiness for independent team structure
- Identify potential team members and executive sponsors
- Define success metrics for skunk works vs traditional development

Status:: #hypothesis/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- [[Front-line Workers]] represent larger market opportunity than traditional video conferencing
- AI device market moving rapidly - need speed over process
- [[SAFe]] framework may be too heavy for breakthrough innovation
- Successful precedent: [[Videoconferencing strategy]] mentions skunk works approach
- Independent teams can move faster without organizational friction
- [[Voice as New Keyboard]] opportunity requires different approach than traditional products

## Evidence Against
- May create conflict with existing product teams and processes
- Risk of duplicating efforts or creating competing priorities
- Organizational culture may not support independent operation
- Resource allocation challenges and political resistance
- Could fragment already limited R&D resources

## Impact if Wrong
- Could create organizational chaos and team conflicts
- Might waste resources on parallel development efforts
- Risk of skunk works team being isolated and eventually killed
- May demotivate existing teams who feel bypassed

## Testing Approach
1. **Week 1-2**: Assess executive appetite for skunk works approach
2. **Week 3-4**: Identify potential team members (technical + product + design)
3. **Month 1**: Define charter, success metrics, and resource requirements
4. **Month 2**: Pilot project scope and deliverables
5. **Month 3**: Measure progress vs traditional development approach

## Success Metrics
- Faster time from concept to prototype (target: 50% faster than traditional)
- Higher innovation quality (breakthrough vs incremental features)
- Team satisfaction and retention in skunk works vs traditional teams
- Customer validation speed and quality
- Market impact and competitive differentiation

## Prerequisites for Success
- Executive sponsorship and protection from organizational interference
- Dedicated budget and resources (not competing with existing projects)
- Clear charter defining autonomy boundaries
- Access to customers and market feedback
- Technical infrastructure and tools independence

## Team Composition (Ideal)
- **Technical Lead**: AI/ML expertise, hardware integration experience
- **Product Lead**: [[Front-line Workers]] domain expertise, customer research skills
- **Design Lead**: Industrial design, user experience for work environments
- **Business Lead**: Go-to-market, partnerships, business model innovation

## Potential Focus Areas
- [[Voice as New Keyboard]] - AI-powered voice interfaces for work
- [[Agentic IT Admins]] - AI agents for IT administration
- Industry-specific AI tools (healthcare, manufacturing, logistics)
- [[Edge Computing]] AI devices for privacy-sensitive environments

## Risk Mitigation
- Regular check-ins with main product organization
- Clear IP and technology sharing agreements
- Defined integration path back to main product line
- Success metrics aligned with overall business strategy
