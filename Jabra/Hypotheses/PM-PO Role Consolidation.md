# Hypothesis: PM-PO Role Consolidation

## 1. Describe Hypothesis

If we merge PM and PO roles into single product ownership positions, then we'll eliminate communication gaps, increase accountability, and improve product team velocity by creating true "CEOs of the product" who own both strategy and execution.

**Confidence:** High - 85%
**Based on:** [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] - "No need for a PM for every product, when we also have a PO for each product!"
**Status:** #hypothesis/untested
**Last Updated:** [[2025-07-30]]

## 2. Tests

### Primary Test Approach
- Pilot with 2-3 products consolidating PM/PO into single role
- Run 3-month pilot with clear success criteria
- Select willing PM/PO pairs for pilot programs
- Provide cross-training on areas outside current expertise

### Success Metrics
- Story completion rate improvement >20%
- Reduction in cross-functional meetings by >30% 
- Team satisfaction scores maintained or improved
- Faster time from idea to development start
- Fewer requirement clarification cycles

## 3. Evidence For

- Current setup creates distance between strategy (PM) and execution (PO)
- Multiple successful companies use single product owner model
- Reduces communication overhead and potential conflicts between PM/PO handoffs  
- [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] observations about PM-dev team distance
- Eliminates the "telephone game" between strategic vision and tactical execution
- Creates clearer accountability chain for product outcomes

## 4. Evidence Against

- Different skill sets required for strategic vs tactical product work
- Risk of overwhelming single person with too much responsibility  
- May need different personalities for internal vs external focus
- Strategic thinking might suffer if person gets too focused on execution details
- Could create burnout risk for consolidated role holders
- Some individuals may excel at one aspect but struggle with the other

## 5. What To Do If We Are Right?
- merge the roles and train engineers to do the actual backlog grooming
