# Hypothesis: Software as an Afterthought

## Describe Hypothesis
As long as software is not integrated with hardware in our discovery and delivery processes, but treated as an afterthought, we will never win. Without the competitive edge from true hardware-software integration, we might as well not make software at all. [[Software]] teams are disconnected from [[Hardware]] development, resulting in reactive feature development and inability to compete.

## Tests
- Run integrated discovery pilot including software from pre-D0/D1 conceptualization
- Measure time from concept to integrated prototype (baseline vs integrated approach)
- Track competitive win rates before/after integration
- Survey customer-reported value of integrated vs separate features
- Compare developer satisfaction in integrated vs siloed teams
- Document decision velocity improvements with unified hardware-software teams

## Evidence For
- [[SWART Structure]] forces all 10 software teams into one ART, creating "ridiculous cognitive load"
- Platform teams operate with 0% [[PM]] allocation - 20% of capacity with no product leadership
- [[Nisse]] explicitly states: "Digital design... is more of an afterthought"
- [[Software Symptoms]]: Sales team "can't compete", management sees "high cost and low delivery"
- Software input comes "after design started" rather than during discovery
- [[Table Stakes Features]] shows reactive "rushing to match [[Logitech]] features"
- Features shipped at 70% functionality due to rushing
- Factory mindset, FOMO-driven development, risk-averse culture

## Evidence Against
- Some recognition of problem exists (this hypothesis itself)
- [[GenAI devices]] initiative shows potential for integrated thinking
- New leadership ([[Non negotiables]]) brings fresh perspective
- Design team vision includes "early discovery that combines hardware and software"
- Some products may genuinely benefit from modular approach
- Integration complexity might slow both hardware and software

## What To Do If We Are Right?
- **Immediate**: Include software in pre-D0/D1 conceptualization, assign [[PMs]] to platform teams
- **Organizational**: Break [[SWART Structure]] into domain teams, merge hardware-software discovery
- **Strategic**: Focus on 2-3 integrated capabilities competitors can't match
- **Cultural**: Replace factory mindset with experimentation, accept feature gaps for innovation
- **Competitive**: Leverage [[Edge AI vs Cloud AI]] for privacy-first positioning
- **Success Metrics**: Integrated prototype speed, customer value, competitive win rate
