# Hypothesis: We Need True Product Leaders

## Describe Hypothesis
Without a 'CEO of the product', we won't be able to succeed. The current [[PM]] team operates more as feature coordinators than true [[Product Managers]], lacking the authority and accountability needed for effective product leadership. No-one actually owns product success. The product leader should operate as a **scientist-entrepreneur** who owns customer outcomes and market success, embracing that 95% of ideas fail and focusing on rapid experimentation rather than perfect planning.

## Tests
- Interview current [[PMs]] about role perception and decision authority
- Document examples of product decisions made without PM input (e.g., "[[Anders]] making calls suddenly")... what happened?
- Document examples where PMs (or other product members) DID act like a CEO of the product... what happened? 

## Evidence For
- [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]]: PMs "seem afraid to have opinions beyond their narrow domains"
- PMs operate at distance from development teams, suggesting limited influence
- [[SAFe]] framework constrains PM authority and ownership
- Feature factory mentality indicates coordination role over ownership
- No clear product accountability when things go wrong
- Products lack clear strategic direction

## Evidence Against
- May be cultural preference for consensus over individual ownership
- PMs might have authority but exercise it differently than expected
- Complex stakeholder environment may require collaborative approach
- Some PMs may be true leaders but constrained by system
- Distributed decision-making could be intentional strategy

## What To Do If We Are Right?
- Redefine PM roles, tech leads, and design leads as true product CEOs
- Grant PMs authority to make product decisions without committee approval
- Change success metrics from features shipped to customer outcomes
- Hire/promote PMs comfortable with ownership and accountability
- Remove organizational barriers to PM decision-making
- Create "Product Leader" role distinct from feature coordination
- Link to [[PM-PO Role Consolidation]] to create single accountable owner
