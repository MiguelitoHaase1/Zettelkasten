# Hypothesis: Technical PM Hiring Priority

Statement:: If we prioritize hiring PMs with strong technical backgrounds over traditional business-focused PMs, then we'll improve developer collaboration, reduce technical debt, and make better architectural decisions

Confidence:: Medium - 65%
Based on:: Observation of PM-developer communication gaps, [[Software Development Center]] technical complexity
Testing via:: 
- Compare outcomes from technical vs business-focused PM hires
- Measure developer satisfaction and collaboration metrics
- Track technical debt accumulation and architectural decision quality

Status:: #hypothesis/untested

## Evidence For
- Complex software products benefit from PMs who understand technical tradeoffs
- Better communication with [[Software Development Center]] developers
- Reduced need for technical translation layers
- Faster, more informed product decisions on technical matters
- Can better balance feature requests with technical sustainability

## Evidence Against
- Risk of over-engineering solutions
- May lack business/market intuition compared to traditional PMs
- Could focus too much on technical elegance vs customer value
- Market understanding might be weaker

## Impact if Wrong
- Could lead to technically impressive but commercially unsuccessful products
- Might alienate business stakeholders who need different communication style
- Risk of losing customer focus for technical perfection

## Testing Approach
1. Next 2-3 PM hires: prioritize technical background over pure business experience
2. Provide business/market training to balance technical skills
3. Compare collaboration metrics with developer teams
4. Track product success metrics vs products managed by business-focused PMs
5. Measure architectural decision quality and technical debt trends

## Success Metrics
- Improved developer satisfaction scores with PM collaboration
- Faster technical decision-making cycles
- Reduced architectural rework and technical debt accumulation
- Maintained or improved customer satisfaction and business metrics

## Key Competencies for Technical PMs
- Understanding of software architecture and scalability
- Ability to assess technical feasibility and effort
- Experience with development processes and tools
