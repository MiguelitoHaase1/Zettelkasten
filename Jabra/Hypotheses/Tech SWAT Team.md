# Hypothesis: Tech SWAT Team

## Describe Hypothesis
If we re-allocate resources from [[The Feature Parity Trap|feature parity]] to a super small SWAT team that can turn around a customer need to delivery in 2 weeks (using [[AI]] tools and radical simplification), we can woo individual beachhead customers in [[Videoconferencing]] and win product-market fit while landing business. Instead of trying to match [[Logitech]] feature-for-feature, we become the vendor that solves YOUR specific problem faster than anyone else.

## Tests
- Select 2-3 high-value prospects with specific unmet needs
- Form 3-person SWAT team (engineer, designer, PM) with full autonomy
- Use [[AI]] tools for rapid prototyping and code generation
- Deliver custom solution in 2 weeks, measure customer delight
- Track: conversion rate, time-to-value, customer advocacy
- Compare wins vs traditional sales cycle with feature checklist approach

## Evidence For
- [[The Feature Parity Trap]] shows we're losing the checklist game anyway
- Enterprise customers often have 1-2 critical unmet needs beyond standard features
- [[AI]] tools can 10x development speed for focused problems
- [[We need less 'cold hands']] - this creates pure builders
- Beachhead customers become strongest advocates and references
- Speed and customization are differentiators [[Logitech]] can't match

## Evidence Against
- Doesn't scale - can't SWAT team every customer
- May create unsupportable custom solutions
- Diverts resources from core product development
- Could fragment product vision with too many one-offs
- [[SAFe]] process and governance will resist this approach
- Risk of setting unrealistic customer expectations

## What To Do If We Are Right?
- Scale from 1 to 3-5 SWAT teams based on success
- Extract patterns from custom solutions into core product
- Use beachhead customers as co-development partners
- Create "Jabra Rapid Response" as premium offering
- Build library of [[AI]]-powered rapid development tools
- Transform won customers into product advisory board
- Redefine [[Videoconferencing]] competitive strategy around responsiveness vs features
