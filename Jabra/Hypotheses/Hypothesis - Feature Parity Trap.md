# Hypothesis: [[Stop Feature Parity Chase]]

If:: We stop chasing feature parity with [[Logitech]] and instead focus on 2-3 differentiated capabilities for [[Jabra+]]
Then:: We will increase win rates by 20% and achieve 10% market share in [[Videoconferencing]] Business within 12 months
Because:: Customers choose products for unique value, not feature checklists, and our resources are better spent on innovation than imitation
Success Metrics:: 
- Win rate improvement from current baseline (measure quarterly)
- Market share growth in [[Videoconferencing]] (from 5% to 10%)
- Customer NPS specifically for differentiated features (>50)
- Sales cycle reduction when leading with differentiated features
Timeline:: Q1 2025 - Q1 2026

## Background Context
- [[Jabra+]] is already "a step behind competitors" 
- Playing catch-up hasn't helped us gain market share (stuck at 5%)
- [[100 day plan at Jabra]] explicitly warns against the "[[Catch-up Trap]]"

## Risks
- [[IT Admins]] need certain table-stakes features for compatibility
- Some [[Buyers]] make decisions based on feature checklists
- May lose deals to [[Logitech]] for missing "must-have" features

## Proposed Differentiation Areas
1. [[Edge AI]] capabilities for secure, local processing
2. Superior [[Meeting Equity]] technology
3. Vertical-specific solutions (healthcare, banking)
