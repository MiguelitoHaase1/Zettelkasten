# Hypothesis: PM-PO Role Consolidation

Statement:: If we merge PM and PO roles into single product ownership positions, then we'll eliminate communication gaps, increase accountability, and improve product team velocity

Confidence:: High - 85%
Based on:: [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] - "No need for a PM for every product, when we also have a PO for each product!"
Testing via:: 
- Pilot with 2-3 products consolidating PM/PO into single role
- Measure story completion rates, team satisfaction, and decision speed
- Track reduction in alignment meetings and handoff friction

Status:: #hypothesis/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- Current setup creates distance between strategy (PM) and execution (PO)
- Multiple successful companies use single product owner model
- Reduces communication overhead and potential conflicts
- [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] observations about PM-dev team distance

## Evidence Against
- Different skill sets required for strategic vs tactical product work
- Risk of overwhelming single person with too much responsibility
- May need different personalities for internal vs external focus

## Impact if Wrong
- Could overburden individuals and reduce quality in both areas
- Might lose strategic thinking if focused too much on execution
- Risk of burning out consolidated role holders

## Testing Approach
1. Select 2-3 product areas for pilot (ideally with willing PM/PO pairs)
2. Define consolidated role responsibilities and success metrics
3. Provide training on areas outside current expertise
4. Run 3-month pilot with clear success criteria
5. Measure team velocity, decision speed, and role satisfaction

## Success Metrics
- Story completion rate improvement >20%
- Reduction in cross-functional meetings by >30%
- Team satisfaction scores maintained or improved
- Faster time from idea to development start
