# Hypothesis: We Need Less 'Cold Hands'

## Describe Hypothesis
Too many thinkers and facilitators... we need builder mindsets and more hot hands - in [[Product Management]], in [[Design]], in [[Engineering]]... even in [[Management]]! The organization is weighted toward coordination and planning rather than actual building and shipping.

## Tests
- Audit current roles: ratio of builders vs coordinators/facilitators
- Track time spent in meetings vs building/shipping
- Pilot "builder-first" teams with minimal coordination overhead
- Measure output: features shipped, prototypes built, customer problems solved
- Compare velocity of builder-heavy teams vs coordinator-heavy teams

## Evidence For
- Current [[SAFe]] process creates many coordination roles
- Multiple layers of [[PM]]/[[PO]] separation from actual building
- Meeting-heavy culture suggests too much coordination
- [[Software Symptoms]] show high cost, low delivery
- Successful tech companies have high builder-to-coordinator ratios

## Evidence Against
- Complex enterprise products may require more coordination
- Distributed teams need facilitation for alignment
- Risk of chaos without proper planning and coordination
- Some facilitation roles add genuine value
- Builder mindset alone doesn't ensure right things get built

## What To Do If We Are Right?
- Restructure teams to maximize builders, minimize coordinators
- Convert facilitation roles to have building responsibilities
- Hire for builder mindset across all functions
- Reduce meeting culture, increase shipping culture
- Celebrate building and shipping over planning and coordinating
- Create "maker time" policies to protect builders from interruptions
