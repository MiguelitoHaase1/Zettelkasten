# Hypothesis: Opinionated PMs Drive Better Outcomes

Statement:: If we hire/develop more opinionated PMs who take strong positions on customer needs and product direction, then we'll achieve better product-market fit and faster decision-making

Confidence:: Medium - 70%
Based on:: [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]], observation that current PMs "seem afraid to have opinions beyond their narrow domains"
Testing via:: 
- Measure decision speed before/after PM coaching on opinion formation
- Track customer satisfaction scores for products with more vs less opinionated PM ownership
- Monitor feature success rates from opinionated vs consensus-driven decisions

Status:: #hypothesis/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] - Current PMs appear risk-averse about taking positions
- Strong product leaders in successful companies are known for clear vision and opinions
- Faster decisions reduce time-to-market

## Evidence Against
- Collaborative environments may benefit from consensus-building
- Domain expertise may be more important than strong opinions
- Risk of wrong opinions causing costly mistakes

## Impact if Wrong
- Could create conflict and reduce team collaboration
- Might lead to poorly-informed strong decisions
- Could alienate current PM talent who prefer collaborative approach

## Testing Approach
1. Identify 2-3 PMs willing to experiment with more opinionated stance
2. Provide coaching on customer research â†’ opinion formation
3. Track outcomes on their products vs control group
4. Measure team satisfaction and decision velocity
