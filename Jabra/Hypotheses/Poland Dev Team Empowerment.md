# Hypothesis: Poland Dev Team Empowerment

## 1. Describe Hypothesis

If we give the [[Software Development Center]] in Poland more product decision-making authority and direct customer access, then we'll improve both product quality and team engagement while reducing coordination overhead by empowering the people closest to the technical implementation.

**Confidence:** Medium-High - 75%
**Based on:** [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]], [[100 day plan at Jabra]] emphasis on getting developers in front of customers/users/partners
**Status:** #hypothesis/untested
**Last Updated:** [[2025-07-30]]

## 2. Tests

### Primary Test Approach
- Select 2-3 features for Poland-led development with direct customer access
- Provide customer research training and direct feedback channels to key Poland team members
- Give decision authority for technical implementation and UX within defined business constraints
- Run comparison vs traditional PM-driven development approach

### Success Metrics
- Feature completion rate improvement >25%
- Reduced development cycle time
- Higher Poland team engagement scores  
- Maintained or improved customer satisfaction scores
- Fewer requirement clarification cycles between teams
- Reduced back-and-forth communication overhead

## 3. Evidence For

- Developers closest to technical constraints often have the best solutions for user problems
- [[100 day plan at Jabra]] explicitly calls for "Get developers, designers, and product managers consistently in front of customers/users/partners"
- Distributed teams work better with autonomy than heavy coordination layers
- [[Software Development Center]] likely has strong technical talent being underutilized for product decisions
- Direct customer feedback creates better understanding than filtered requirements
- Reduces the "telephone game" effect in requirement translation

## 4. Evidence Against

- Risk of technically excellent but commercially misaligned products
- Potential for inconsistent user experience across different products  
- May require significant upskilling in customer research and business context
- Could create role friction with existing PM/PO responsibilities
- Time zone challenges for direct customer interaction
- Business strategy context may be lost without PM filtering

## 5. What To Do If We Are Right?

### Immediate Actions
1. **Pilot Selection:** Choose 2-3 low-risk features for Poland-led development
2. **Training Program:** Provide customer research and business context training
3. **Direct Channels:** Establish customer feedback channels (calls, usage data access)
4. **Authority Definition:** Clearly define decision boundaries and business constraints
5. **Communication Structure:** Set up regular sync points with business stakeholders

### Long-term Changes
1. **Organizational Model:** Restructure to give Poland team more product ownership
2. **Skill Development:** Invest in customer research and business acumen for technical teams
3. **Process Redesign:** Eliminate unnecessary coordination layers between Poland and business teams
4. **Career Paths:** Create technical product leadership roles for Poland-based developers
5. **Customer Access:** Institutionalize direct developer-customer interaction across all products

### Prerequisites for Success
- Clear business context and constraint communication
- Customer research skills training for key Poland team members  
- Direct feedback channels (customer calls, usage data access)
- Authority boundaries clearly defined with business stakeholders
