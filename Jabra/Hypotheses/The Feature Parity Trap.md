# Hypothesis: Avoid feature Parity Trap - go for a beachhead

## Describe Hypothesis
We should stop chasing feature parity with [[Logitech]] and instead focus on 2-3 differentiated capabilities for [[Jabra+]]. Playing catch-up hasn't helped us gain market share (stuck below 5%). Customers choose products for unique value, not feature checklists, and our resources are better spent on innovation than imitation.

Most importantly, we can not win the market by going for the whole market in one sweep. We need to define a beachhead customer, and focus on that first--- so narrow that Cisco/logitech/Polly wouldn't care as much as we do about them.

## Tests
- Define and develop 2-3 differentiated capabilities (Q1 2025)
- Lead sales pitches with differentiated features vs feature comparison
- Measure win rates quarterly against baseline
- Track customer NPS specifically for differentiated features (target >50)
- Monitor sales cycle reduction when leading with unique value

## Evidence For
- [[Jabra+]] is already "a step behind competitors" despite catch-up efforts
- Playing catch-up hasn't helped us gain market share (stuck at 5%)
- [[100 day plan at Jabra]] explicitly warns against the "[[Catch-up Trap]]"
- Customers choose products for unique value, not feature checklists
- Resources better spent on innovation than imitation

## Evidence Against
- [[IT Admins]] need certain table-stakes features for compatibility
- Some [[Buyers]] make decisions based on feature checklists
- May lose deals to [[Logitech]] for missing "must-have" features
- Risk of being seen as incomplete solution
- Enterprise buyers often have strict requirements

## What To Do If We Are Right?
- Define a clear beachhead segment - e.g., innovative tech companies like Spotify, Zendesk, Loveable,...
- Double down on differentiation areas where we can win and beachhead customer appreciates it: [[Edge AI]] capabilities, [[Meeting Equity]] technology, vertical-specific solutions
- Reallocate resources from catch-up features to tailored innovation for the beachhead
- Train sales team on value-based selling vs feature comparison
- Bring Product managers/engineers into the pitches, and let them turn around a customer need in 2 weeks
