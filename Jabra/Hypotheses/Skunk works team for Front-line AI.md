# Hypothesis: We need a ront-line AI Skunk Works

## Describe Hypothesis
If we create an independent [[Skunk Works]] team to develop AI-powered devices for [[Front-line Workers]], then we'll accelerate innovation and avoid organizational constraints that slow breakthrough product development. [[Front-line Workers]] represent a larger market than [[Videoconferencing]], but require rapid AI innovation that [[SAFe's factory mindset]] framework cannot support.

## Tests
- Assess executive appetite and sponsorship for independent team (Week 1-2)
- Identify 4-person team: Technical Lead (AI/ML), Product Lead (Front-line expertise), Design Lead (industrial/UX), Business Lead (go-to-market)
- Define charter with clear autonomy boundaries and success metrics
- Run 3-month pilot comparing speed vs traditional development
- Measure: concept-to-prototype time (target 50% faster), innovation quality, customer validation speed

## Evidence For
- [[Front-line Workers]] represent larger market opportunity than traditional video conferencing
- AI device market moving rapidly - need speed over process
- [[SAFe's factory mindset]] framework too heavy for breakthrough innovation
- [[Videoconferencing strategy]] mentions successful skunk works precedent
- Independent teams move faster without organizational friction
- [[Voice as New Keyboard]] opportunity requires different approach

## Evidence Against
- May create conflict with existing product teams and processes
- Risk of duplicating efforts or creating competing priorities
- Organizational culture may not support independent operation
- Resource allocation challenges and political resistance
- Could fragment already limited R&D resources
- Skunk works teams can become isolated from core business

## What To Do If We Are Right?
- Hire and organize for a Skunk works team for GenAI device/front-line workers
