# Hypothesis: Developer-Customer Direct Connection

Statement:: If we establish direct communication channels between developers and customers/users (bypassing traditional PM gatekeeping), then we'll achieve faster problem resolution, better technical solutions, and higher developer motivation

Confidence:: High - 80%
Based on:: [[100 day plan at Jabra]] goal D: "Get developers, designers, and product managers consistently in front of customers/users/partners"
Testing via:: 
- Create direct developer-customer touchpoints (support escalations, user interviews, usage data access)
- Measure solution quality, development speed, and developer satisfaction
- Track customer satisfaction with technical solutions

Status:: #hypothesis/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- Developers understand technical constraints and possibilities better than PMs
- Direct feedback eliminates "telephone game" distortion
- Higher developer motivation when they see impact on real users
- Faster iterations when developers can clarify requirements directly
- [[100 day plan at Jabra]] explicitly calls for this approach

## Evidence Against
- Risk of developers focusing on interesting technical problems vs business priorities
- Potential for inconsistent customer communication
- May require significant training for customer-facing skills
- Could undermine PM role and create role confusion

## Impact if Wrong
- Could lead to customer confusion with multiple contact points
- Risk of developers making promises outside business strategy
- Potential for technically elegant but commercially irrelevant solutions

## Testing Approach
1. Start with controlled scenarios: support escalations, specific user research sessions
2. Train select developers in customer communication and business context
3. Create structured feedback loops (monthly customer calls, usage data dashboards)
4. Pilot with 2-3 customer-facing developers per product team
5. Measure both technical and business outcomes

## Success Metrics
- Faster resolution time for customer technical issues
- Higher developer engagement and satisfaction scores
- Improved customer satisfaction with technical solutions
- Reduced requirements clarification cycles
- Maintained alignment with business objectives

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Reactive - developers join customer support escalations
2. **Phase 2**: Proactive - developers participate in user research sessions  
3. **Phase 3**: Autonomous - developers have direct access to customer usage data and feedback

## Skills Required
- Customer communication training for developers
- Business context education
- Clear escalation paths for business decisions
- Guidelines for what developers can/cannot commit to customers
