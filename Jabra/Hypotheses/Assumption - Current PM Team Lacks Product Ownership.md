# Assumption: Current PM Team Lacks Product Ownership

Statement:: The current PM team operates more as feature coordinators than true product owners, lacking the authority and accountability needed for effective product leadership

Confidence:: High - 85%
Based on:: [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] - PMs "seem afraid to have opinions beyond their narrow domains", distance from development teams
Testing via:: 
- Survey current PMs on decision-making authority and accountability
- Map actual vs desired PM responsibilities and influence
- Assess PM involvement in strategic product decisions

Status:: #assumption/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] - PMs appear reluctant to take strong positions
- Observation of PM-developer distance suggesting limited influence
- [[SAFe]] framework may be constraining PM authority and ownership
- Feature factory mentality suggests coordination over ownership role

## Evidence Against
- May be cultural preference for consensus over individual ownership
- PMs might have authority but exercise it differently than expected
- Could be appropriate given complex stakeholder environment

## Impact if True
- Products lack clear strategic direction and accountability
- Slower decision-making and reduced innovation
- Developer teams may lack clear product vision and priorities
- Risk of building features without clear user value proposition

## Testing Questions
1. What decisions can PMs make without seeking approval?
2. How do PMs measure success - features shipped or user outcomes?
3. Do PMs feel accountable for product success or just delivery?
4. What happens when PMs disagree with stakeholder requests?

## Validation Approach
- Interview current PMs about their role perception and constraints
- Review PM job descriptions vs actual responsibilities
- Assess PM involvement in roadmap and strategy decisions
- Survey developers on PM leadership and direction-setting

## Implications for Change
- May need to redefine PM roles with clearer ownership and authority
- Could require organizational changes to support PM decision-making
- Might need different PM personas who are comfortable with ownership
