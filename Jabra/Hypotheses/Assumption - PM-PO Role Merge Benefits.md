# Assumption: PM-PO Role Merge Benefits

Statement:: Merging PM and PO roles will immediately improve team efficiency, reduce communication overhead, and increase product accountability

Confidence:: High - 90%
Based on:: [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] - "We have to merge the PO and PM role. No need for a PM for every product, when we also have a PO for each product!"
Testing via:: 
- Immediate pilot with willing PM/PO pairs
- Measure meeting reduction, decision speed, and team satisfaction
- Track story completion rates and development velocity

Status:: #assumption/untested
Last Updated:: [[2025-07-30]]

## Evidence For
- [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]] direct observation of redundant roles
- Clear communication bottlenecks between strategic (PM) and tactical (PO) functions
- Successful single product owner models in other organizations
- Reduces handoff delays and alignment meetings
- Single point of accountability for product success

## Evidence Against
- Different skill sets required for strategic vs execution focus
- Risk of role overload leading to poor performance in both areas
- May need different personality types for internal vs external focus
- Could lose specialization benefits

## Impact if Wrong
- Could overwhelm individuals and reduce quality in strategic thinking
- Might create burnout in consolidated roles
- Risk of losing either strategic vision or execution excellence

## Immediate Testing Approach
1. **Week 1-2**: Identify 2-3 willing PM/PO pairs for pilot
2. **Week 3-4**: Define consolidated role scope and success metrics
3. **Month 1**: Begin pilot with clear boundaries and support
4. **Month 2-3**: Measure outcomes vs control groups

## Success Metrics
- **Immediate (Week 1-4)**: 
  - Reduction in alignment meetings by >40%
  - Faster requirement clarification cycles
- **Short-term (Month 1-3)**:
  - Story completion rate improvement >25%
  - Developer satisfaction with product direction
  - Maintained or improved strategic thinking quality

## Prerequisites for Success
- Clear role definition combining strategic and tactical responsibilities
- Training/coaching for areas outside current expertise
- Executive support for organizational change
- Success celebration to encourage broader adoption

## Organizational Impact
- May require updating job descriptions and career paths
- Could influence hiring strategy for future product roles
- Might need different compensation structure for expanded responsibilities
