# Customer Interview Principles

These principles operationalize the [[Customer Discovery Principles]] belief system and embody [[The Mom Test]] approach to getting honest customer feedback. They support the [[Scientist vs Factory Manager Mindset]] by treating customer conversations as experiments.

## Foundation: Three Cardinal Rules

### 1. Ask About Their Life, Not Our Ideas

**Why:** Customers can't accurately predict their future behavior, but they can accurately describe their current reality. This principle directly implements [[The Mom Test]] and uncovers real [[Jobs To Be Done]].

**In Practice:**

- ❌ "Would you use a feature that does X?"
- ✅ "Walk me through how you currently handle Y"
- ❌ "Do you think this would be valuable?"
- ✅ "What's the most frustrating part of your current process?"

### 2. Ask About Specifics in Their Past, Not Opinions About the Future

This embodies [[The Scientific Method for Products]] by gathering observable data rather than speculation.

**Why:** Memory of specific events reveals true behavior patterns and emotional triggers.

**In Practice:**

- ❌ "What would you typically do in this situation?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time this happened to you"
- ❌ "How important is speed to you?"
- ✅ "Describe a time when slowness really cost you"

**Follow-up Technique:** The "Last Time" method

- "When was the last time you..."
- "What exactly happened?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do next?"

### 3. Dig Deeper When You Hear Emotional Signals

**Why:** Emotion indicates pain points worth solving and reveals the [[Jobs To Be Done]] customers are truly hiring products to do - especially the emotional and social dimensions beyond just functional needs.

**Emotional Signal Indicators:**

- Voice changes (frustration, excitement, resignation)
- Strong language ("I hate when...", "It drives me crazy...")
- Physical reactions (sighing, leaning forward)
- Repeated mentions of the same issue

**Digging Deeper Techniques:**

- "That sounds frustrating - tell me more about that"
- "You mentioned X twice - why is that so important?"
- "What makes that particularly challenging?"
- "How does that affect the rest of your day/work?"

## Interview Structure Framework

### Opening (Set the Context)

"I'm trying to understand how people currently handle [problem area]. I'm not here to sell you anything - just to learn from your experience."

### Core Discovery (80% of time)

Follow the three principles above, focusing on:

- Current state behavior
- Specific past incidents
- Emotional reactions
- Workarounds and compromises

### Closing (Validate Understanding)

"Let me make sure I understand..." and summarize their biggest pain points back to them.

## Red Flags to Avoid

These anti-patterns violate [[First Principle Thinking]] and [[The Scientific Method for Products]]:

- Leading questions that suggest answers
- Asking about features instead of problems
- Accepting vague generalizations
- Moving on when you sense emotion
- Talking more than listening

## Connection to Broader Framework

These principles feed directly into [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] by revealing the four forces. They also support:

- What's pushing them away from current solutions
- What progress they're trying to make
- What anxieties might prevent change
- What would pull them toward new solutions

This creates the data needed for [[Adaptive Strategy]] and enables teams to move [[Above vs Below the Line]] by taking ownership of customer understanding rather than making excuses.
