No enough, but its getting better. Especially our 'admins' team have great access to the IT-admins that use the systems. We have even very large ones that are willing to sit down for days and hours to discuss product improvement and innovation with us. But we are not doing a good enough job to get these interactions to the full-team (i.e. its mostly product manager and sometimes product owner) that gets this airtime. That's easy to fix though. End-users are slightly more tricky as they are generally quite low involvement users (how passionate would you be around your headset app? ðŸ˜‰), but there are of course millions of them. We have a e-mail database with around 1m users that we frequently survey, do focus groups with, etc. We have also used companies like Testbird in the past.
