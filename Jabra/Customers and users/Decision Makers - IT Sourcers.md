IT Sourcers are one of the key decision makers for Jabra software purchases, particularly for enterprise-wide deployments.

## Primary Focus Areas

- **Security** - Compliance with enterprise security standards
- **System Integration** - Compatibility with existing IT infrastructure
- **Vendor Management** - Consolidated purchasing and support
- **Total Cost of Ownership** - Long-term financial impact

## What They Care About

### Security & Compliance

- Data privacy (GDPR, CCPA)
- Encryption standards
- Access controls and audit trails

### Integration Requirements
- API availability and quality
- SSO/SAML support
- Directory service integration (AD, LDAP)
- Compatibility with existing tools

## How They Differ From Other Stakeholders

- Think strategically about vendor relationships
- Consider enterprise-wide standards
- Focus on procurement and contracts
- May not be daily users of the tools

## Implications for Product Strategy
