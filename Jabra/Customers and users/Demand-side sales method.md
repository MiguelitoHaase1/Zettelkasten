# Demand-Side Sales Methodology

This methodology operationalizes [[Jobs To Be Done]] theory for sales and product development. It embodies [[First Principle Thinking]] by examining the fundamental forces that drive customer behavior rather than surface-level feature requests.

## Core Principle

**Consumers don't buy products, they buy better versions of themselves.** Every purchase decision is driven by the progress a customer is trying to make in their life.

This aligns with [[Jobs To Be Done]] - customers hire products to make functional, emotional, and social progress.

## The Four Forces Framework

This framework provides a [[First Principle Thinking]] approach to understanding customer decisions, supporting [[The Scientific Method for Products]] by identifying testable hypotheses about customer behavior.

Every customer decision involves four competing forces. Map all four to understand and influence purchase decisions.

### 1. Pull of Existing Habits (Status Quo Bias)

**Definition:** The comfort and familiarity of current solutions, even when imperfect.

**Discovery Questions:**

- "How do you handle this today?"
- "What would happen if you did nothing?"
- "What's working well enough about your current approach?"

**Why It Matters:** This is often the strongest force. Customers need compelling reasons to overcome inertia.

### 2. Push of Current Solution (Pain Points)

**Definition:** Frustrations, limitations, and failures that motivate customers to seek alternatives.

**Discovery Questions:**

- "What's not working about your current solution?"
- "What triggers you to look for something better?"
- "What does the current situation cost you?"

**Why It Matters:** This creates the energy for change. Without sufficient push, customers won't move.

### 3. Anxiety About New Solution (Change Resistance)

**Definition:** Fears, uncertainties, and risks associated with adopting something new.

**Common Anxieties:**

- Learning curve concerns
- Integration challenges
- Cost/ROI uncertainty
- Team adoption resistance
- Switching costs

**Discovery Questions:**

- "What worries you most about making a change?"
- "What would need to be true for this to be a no-brainer?"
- "What's held you back from solving this before?"

### 4. Pull of New Solution (Attraction Factors)

**Definition:** The compelling benefits and outcomes that draw customers toward change.

**Discovery Questions:**

- "What would success look like for you?"
- "How would solving this change your day/work/life?"
- "What's the biggest opportunity you see?"

## The Purchase Decision Formula

```
Change Happens When: (Push + Pull New) > (Pull Old + Anxiety)
```

## Three Dimensions of Customer Motivation

### Functional Motivation

**The Job to Be Done**

- What task needs accomplishing?
- What capability is missing?
- What efficiency gain is needed?

### Emotional Motivation

**How They Want to Feel**

- Confident vs. Anxious
- In control vs. Overwhelmed
- Professional vs. Amateur
- Innovative vs. Behind

### Social Motivation

**How They Want to Be Perceived**

- By peers, team, boss, industry
- As competent, forward-thinking, reliable
- As someone who makes good decisions

## Demand-Side Discovery Questions

These questions implement [[Customer Discovery Principles]] and [[The Mom Test]] to uncover the four forces:

### Triggering Event Questions

- "What triggered you to start looking for a new solution?"
- "What happened that made you realize you needed to change?"
- "When did you first notice this was becoming a problem?"

### Progress Questions

These directly map to [[Jobs To Be Done]] theory:

- "What progress are you trying to make in your life/work?"
- "If this works perfectly, how will your life be different?"
- "What would have to be true for this to be transformational?"

### Decision Process Questions

- "What happened during your decision-making process?"
- "Who else was involved in evaluating options?"
- "What criteria mattered most in your evaluation?"

### Success Vision Questions

- "What does success look like for you after using this?"
- "How will you know this was the right decision?"
- "What would make you regret not making this change?"

## Practical Application

### Before Customer Conversations

Map what you know about each force:

1. What might they be comfortable with today?
2. What pain points might they have?
3. What might make them anxious about change?
4. What outcomes might excite them?

### During Conversations

Listen for indicators of each force and dig deeper using [[Customer interview principles]]. Apply [[The Scientific Method for Products]] by treating each conversation as an experiment.

### After Conversations

Update your four-forces map and identify which forces need strengthening or addressing. This supports [[Adaptive Strategy]] by providing data to pivot based on real customer insights.

## Connection to Customer Interview Framework

This methodology provides the strategic context for [[Customer interview principles]] and guides the selection of [[Jabra/Customers and users/Customer discovery questions]]. It embodies the [[Scientist vs Factory Manager Mindset]] by focusing on learning and adaptation rather than just execution.
