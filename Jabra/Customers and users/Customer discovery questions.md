# Customer Discovery Questions

## Question Categories Overview

This tactical guide provides specific questions organized by discovery objective. Use in conjunction with [[Customer interview principles]] and [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]]. These questions embody the [[Customer Discovery Principles]] belief and support [[The Scientific Method for Products]] approach to validation.

## Core Problem Discovery Questions

These questions help uncover the [[Jobs To Be Done]] that customers are trying to accomplish - the functional, emotional, and social progress they seek.

### A. What is the hardest part about...?

**Purpose:** Uncover the most painful aspects of their current situation.

**Question Framework:**

- "What's the hardest part about [relevant process/area]?"
- "What's the most frustrating thing about how you handle [X] today?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [process], what would it be?"

**Follow-up Probes:**

- "How often does this happen?"
- "What makes it so difficult?"
- "Who else does this affect?"

### B. Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem

**Purpose:** Get specific, concrete examples rather than generalizations.

**Question Framework:**

- "Tell me about the last time this happened to you"
- "Walk me through exactly what occurred"
- "Describe a recent situation where [problem] came up"

**Follow-up Sequence:**

1. "What led up to that situation?"
2. "What did you do first?"
3. "How did that work out?"
4. "What happened next?"
5. "How did you feel about the outcome?"

### C. How did you deal with the problem today?

**Purpose:** Understand current workarounds, tools, and processes.

**Exploration Areas:**

- Tools and systems used
- People involved
- Time invested
- Workarounds and hacks

### D. What does this problem cost you?

**Purpose:** Quantify impact and understand true business value. This helps validate whether solving the problem aligns with [[Outcome Over Output]] principles.

**Purpose:** Quantify impact and understand true business value.

**Cost Dimensions to Explore:**

**Question Framework:**

- "What does it cost you when this doesn't work well?"
- "How much time do you spend on [workaround]?"
- "What opportunities are you missing because of this?"

### E. What have you already tried to solve it?

**Purpose:** Understand previous attempts and why they failed. This prevents repeating mistakes and supports [[First Principle Thinking]] by revealing what doesn't work.

**Purpose:** Understand previous attempts and why they failed.

**Question Framework:**

- "What have you tried to solve this before?"
- "What other solutions have you looked at?"
- "What stopped you from moving forward with [previous attempt]?"

**Key Learning Areas:**

- Budget allocated to solutions
- Evaluation criteria used
- Reasons for rejection
- Lessons learned
- Remaining concerns

## Demand-Side Discovery Questions

These questions map directly to the four forces in [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] and help identify the [[Jobs To Be Done]] framework components:

### Triggering Event Questions

**Purpose:** Identify what creates urgency for change.

- "What triggered you to start looking for a new solution?"
- "What changed that made this a priority now?"
- "What was the final straw that made you realize you needed to act?"
- "When did you first notice this becoming a real problem?"

### Progress Questions

**Purpose:** Understand the job they're hiring a solution to do. This directly applies [[Jobs To Be Done]] theory to uncover functional, emotional, and social progress desired.

- "What progress are you trying to make in your life/work?"
- "If this works perfectly, how will your life be different?"
- "What would success look like six months from now?"
- "What job are you trying to get done that you can't do today?"

### Decision Process Questions

**Purpose:** Map the buying journey and key stakeholders.

- "What happened during your decision-making process?"
- "Who else was involved in evaluating options?"
- "What criteria mattered most in your evaluation?"
- "How do decisions like this typically get made at your company?"
- "What would need to be true for you to feel confident moving forward?"

### Success Vision Questions

**Purpose:** Understand desired outcomes and success metrics.

- "What does success look like for you after using this?"
- "How will you know this was the right decision?"
- "What would make you thrilled that you made this change?"
- "How will you measure the impact of this solution?"

## Question Sequences by Force

### Mapping Pull of Status Quo

1. "How do you handle this today?"
2. "What's working well about your current approach?"
3. "What would happen if you changed nothing?"
4. "What keeps you using the current solution?"

### Mapping Push Away from Current

1. "What's not working about how you do this today?"
2. "What frustrates you most about the current situation?"
3. "Tell me about the last time this really caused problems"
4. "What does the current situation cost you?"

### Mapping Anxiety About New

1. "What concerns you most about making a change?"
2. "What's held you back from solving this before?"
3. "What would need to be true for this to feel like a safe bet?"
4. "What are you most worried could go wrong?"

### Mapping Pull Toward New

1. "What excites you most about solving this?"
2. "How would your life/work change if this worked perfectly?"
3. "What's the biggest opportunity you see?"
4. "What would success look like?"

## Advanced Question Techniques

### The "Why" Ladder

This technique embodies [[First Principle Thinking]] by digging past surface answers to fundamental truths:

Start with surface-level answers and dig deeper:

1. Initial answer
2. "Why is that important to you?"
3. "And why does that matter?"
4. "What's driving that need?"
5. Continue until you hit emotional bedrock

### The Comparison Question

"How does [current solution] compare to [alternative approach]?"

- Reveals evaluation criteria
- Uncovers hidden requirements
- Shows relative priorities

### The Counterfactual Question

"What would have to be different for you to love your current solution?"

- Identifies minimum viable improvements
- Reveals core job-to-be-done
- Tests attachment to status quo

## Question Selection Guidelines

### Early in Conversation (Build Trust)

- Start with current state questions
- Focus on their world, not your solution
- Ask about specific past experiences

### Middle of Conversation (Go Deep)

- Dig into emotional signals
- Explore costs and consequences
- Map the four forces

### End of Conversation (Validate Understanding)

- Summarize what you heard
- Confirm priority of problems
- Test your understanding of their success vision

## Red Flag Questions to Avoid

These violate [[Customer Discovery Principles]] and [[The Mom Test]] by asking hypothetical or leading questions:

- "Would you use a product that does X?" (Hypothetical future)
- "How important is [feature] to you?" (Leading/assumptive)
- "Don't you think X would be better?" (Leading)
- "What features would you want?" (Solution-focused)
