# Users - Hybrid Team Leaders

## Role as End Users

Hybrid Team Leaders and actual end users represent the people who directly benefit from Jabra's products in their daily work.

## Core Needs

### Better Meetings
- Clear audio and video quality
- Easy meeting start/join
- Reliable connections
- Intuitive controls

### Remote Collaboration
- Seamless hybrid meeting experience
- Equal participation for remote/in-room
- Effective screen sharing
- Natural conversation flow

### Meeting Equity
- "Everyone participate in meetings equally"
- Remote participants feel included
- In-room participants clearly heard
- No "second-class" attendees

## The Gap

These users often have little input into purchase decisions, yet they:
- Determine actual product adoption
- Generate support tickets when unhappy
- Influence future purchases through feedback
- Drive real business value (or not)

## What They Don't Care About

Unlike [[Users - IT Admins]], they don't want to think about:
- Firmware versions
- Network configurations  
- Device management
- Technical specifications

## Implications for Product Strategy

### Current State
- Products often optimized for IT admins
- User experience secondary to management
- Features driven by buyer checklists

### Needed Shift
- Design for end user delight
- Make IT management invisible
- Focus on meeting outcomes
- Measure actual usage and satisfaction
