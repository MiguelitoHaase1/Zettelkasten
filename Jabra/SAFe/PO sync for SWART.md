1st: bug with Ursa... we didn't have the right people in the room
2nd: Going through a small bug in Android, that was mentioned in some Teams meeting

80% of conversations are relevant for <20% of people.

Feels like a **"controllers controlling the controllers"** meeting, not a real context and problem solving and coordination exercise... Easier done in a document asynchronously.
