The [[NEIW]] model is waterfall by nature -- giving leadership more context and decision making than we'll need in software. 

Problem is this:
- Hearing has clock speed from explore->launch of 24-48 months - perfect for NEIW.
- hardware is 18-24 months - ok for NEIW.
- Software should be 1-3 months maximum

Due to the 10X higher clock-speed in software, it is simply impossible for leadership to meaningfully engage... more empowerment and lower-level decision making is the only option. (we definitely cannot solve it by having 10X more meetings :-))
