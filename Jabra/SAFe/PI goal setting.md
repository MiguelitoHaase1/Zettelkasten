Currently, the PI goal is being set after PI planning after deciding features by the team...
Anders sets Business Objectives upfront - but they are kind of feature requests.

Better approach: 
I: Product management sets long-term strategic themes with OKRs and priorities (long-running strategy/vision work)

II: For each PI, product management sets 
a) "High commitment/integrity goals" which are concrete bug fixes, features etc... as few as possible of these
b) A proposed PI goal upfront for team to pivot on: Stack ranked set of Outcomes/JTBDs

III: PI Planning - team together translates (II) to actual ADO stack with storypoints etc

IV: We observe how much PI goals stay/change during planning. Over time, they should become stable.... this will serve as a reality-check of the roadmap in each PI, as PI goals get tested with reality story point estimation.
