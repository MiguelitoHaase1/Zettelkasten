Monthly session with senior management.

Identifies new opportunities (e.g., epics) to potentially push into product teams.

### Strengths: 
Helps surface new complexity creating initiatives, so we can avoid overloading teams.

### Weaknesses:
Leadership doesn't have sufficient context to make such calls - this should belong in product teams. Particularly, because many opportunities are too small.

### Recommendation:
Get Product managers to make these calls instead.
