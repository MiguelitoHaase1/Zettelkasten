# SAFe Exit Strategy

## The Approach

[[Anders]]'s pragmatic strategy for transforming away from [[SAFe's factory mindset]] without triggering the [[SAFe Immune System]].

## Step 1: Make SAFe Boring (Early 2025)

"Make the next SAFe really boring by doing tweaks to the existing model"

### Tactical Changes
- Reorganize agile teams â†’ product teams
- Change role scopes gradually
- Eliminate a few redundant roles
- Ensure each team has clear leader

### Key Insight
"Getting such a leader in place will then make all the overhead roles redundant; and when that becomes obvious, then a re-org can be discussed."

## Step 2: Demonstrate Success

- Run pilots with new model
- Show measurable improvements
- Build coalition of supporters
- Create success stories

## Step 3: Expand Gradually

Two potential paths:
1. **(a) Move SW out of SAFe** - Software-specific approach
2. **(b) Move SW out of R&D org** - More radical separation

Both contingent on transformation success.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't attack SAFe directly
- Don't challenge [[R&D Symphony Orchestra Metaphor]]
- Don't eliminate all roles at once
- Don't surprise the CEO

## Political Considerations

### Allies
- CEO [[Peter Karlstromer]] - feels "wrong track"
- EVP [[Calum MacDougall]] - supportive
- SW development center leader - aligned

### Opponents
- [[Christophe]] - will fight hard
- [[Cassie]] - PMO investment
- Transformation team - jobs at risk

## Timeline Expectations

- **Q1 2025**: Begin "boring SAFe" changes
- **Q2-Q3 2025**: Pilot teams show results
- **Q4 2025**: Obvious redundancies emerge
- **2026**: Potential reorganization discussion

## Success Metrics

Track improvements in:
- Delivery velocity
- Customer satisfaction
- Team autonomy
- Innovation metrics
- Employee engagement

## Contingency Plans

If CEO "pulls blanket completely":
- Have transformation plan ready
- Identify quick wins
- Prepare change management
- Line up external support
