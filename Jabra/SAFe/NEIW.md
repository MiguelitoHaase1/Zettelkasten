- Stage Gate Criteria: "WE KNOW THE NEED"
- Outcome: Validated problem space ready for ideation

**Conceptualize Phase → D1**

- Decision Gate: Decision to start design and develop
- Key Activity: Generate and evaluate solution concepts
- Stage Gate Criteria: "WE KNOW THE SOLUTION"
- Outcome: Selected concept with clear value proposition

**Design & Develop Phase → D2**

- Decision Gate: Decision to commit
- Key Activity: Build and test the experience solution
- Stage Gate Criteria: "WE CAN DELIVER"
- Outcome: Validated solution ready for market preparation

**Finalize Heartbeat Phase → D3**

- Decision Gate: Decision to launch
- Key Activity: Prepare for market introduction and scale
- Stage Gate Criteria: "WE DELIVER WITH PRIDE"
- Outcome: Market-ready experience with success metrics

**In Market Phase → D4**

- Decision Gate: Decision to discontinue
- Key Activity: Monitor performance and optimize
- Stage Gate Criteria: Performance tracking and iteration
