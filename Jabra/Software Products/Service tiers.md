[[Jabra Services]] - is another piece of work on the side of products, where we want to have these service tiers given to the customers. Particularly of our video conferencing and headsets. So they link to Jabra plus. There's a lot of issues for without release or prioritization coming from Lauren and others. And I'm imagining that will be a real difficult stage. Nisa also said that this is something that will burn very soon and be difficult. Because there's a lot of requirements for management, but actually like several years of work from what they're requiring. So we need to really prioritize here. The people who will work on this is Jesper and Jeppe and John Hand as a stakeholder. So Jesper and Jeppe will come with a proposal and that will be quite a fire to shut down. As other people give strong recommendations, but demand too much.
