What we really want for [[Feature Parity Trap]] in [[Jabra+]] is to give [[IT admins]] peace of mind and time back... current hypothesis is that it's done with feature pick-up (alerts and remote management)... but we can do it much smarter by leapfrogging to agents. 

Current approach: We're working too linearly, as shown below, where we believe we need to go device data fix -> to APIs/SDKs fix -> to App fix... and only then can consider Agentification--- shouldn't we leapfrog? do like developing Africa did with the mobile phones, and don't start laying old telephone lines in the ground first.

The agent way: 
- We don't need to be world leaders --- we just want to get up-to-par on IT admin capabilities, so they can feel at ease. 
- We can do that by designing our full stack for an agentic world (data, API, and MCPs)
- We could super-charge that by finding a development partner who can guide it - example how about we get Sierra.ai to build agents on our API... providing feedback on our API and making a superior IT admin experience?
- Sidekick: Since, we just want to be on-par - how about we do it WITH Logitech. We'd get critical mass to be interesting with Sierra, we'd be better able to train IT admins in new behavior when we don't go along, and we'd be able to convince people internally when we have Logitech with us.
