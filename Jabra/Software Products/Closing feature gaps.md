In [[video conferencing]] we want to 'get to feature parity'... but on what?

Likely:
- Remote Access
- Alerts

Both those have an underlying JTBD of giving IT admins peace of mind and increasing their productivity... Both can be fixed with a GenAI setup for device management (in room trouble shooting, onboarding, fixing)

Perhaps
- ServiceNow integration?
- Cloud API?

Likely not
- Room insights and utilization
- Peak into room

Question: What is 'Room services'?
