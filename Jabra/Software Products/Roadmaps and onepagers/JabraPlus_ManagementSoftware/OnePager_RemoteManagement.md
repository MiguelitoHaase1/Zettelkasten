## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Points

_"When something goes wrong in a meeting room, I can't see what's happening or help without physically being there."_

_"I would like to provide a white-glove service for my most important users, by being able to start meetings or quickly adjust parameters"_

### Job to be Done

Enable IT admins to remotely access Jabra video devices—including touch controllers and room camera views—for real-time diagnosis, issue resolution, and proactive support delivery without requiring on-site technician deployment.

### Target User

IT administrators using Jabra Plus Enhanced and Enterprise tiers who manage distributed meeting room environments and require rapid issue resolution capabilities

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Physical support requirements create significant operational inefficiencies:

- **Extended Downtime**: Meeting room issues persist until technicians can physically respond, disrupting business operations
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited on-site technical staff availability, especially across distributed or global organizations
- **Support Cost Escalation**: Every issue requires expensive technician dispatch, regardless of complexity
- **User Frustration**: Meeting participants experience delays and disruptions while waiting for technical support
- **Diagnostic Limitations**: IT teams rely on incomplete user reports without direct visibility into device status and room conditions

### Business Value Proposition

Remote access capabilities enable transformational support delivery:

- **Proactive Service**: IT teams can identify and resolve issues before users are impacted
- **White-Glove Experience**: Premium support delivery for executive and high-priority meeting spaces
- **Cost Optimization**: Significant reduction in technician dispatch requirements and associated travel costs
- **Response Time**: Immediate issue diagnosis and resolution without physical travel delays

## Solution Framework

### Current State Limitation

Jabra Plus currently offers:

- **No Remote Access**: IT administrators cannot view or interact with device interfaces remotely
- **Limited Visibility**: No real-time camera feeds or touch controller access for troubleshooting
- **Physical Dependency**: All support activities require on-site technician presence

### Proposed Remote Access Architecture

**Core Components:**

1. **Secure Remote UI Access**: Complete touch panel interface control with full functionality replication
2. **Live Camera Feeds**: Real-time room video access for visual troubleshooting and user assistance
3. **Remote Diagnostics**: Comprehensive device status monitoring and configuration adjustment capabilities
4. **Session Management**: Role-based access controls with comprehensive logging and user consent protocols

### Success Metrics

- **Remote Resolution Rate**: IT administrators successfully resolve issues through remote access without requiring physical presence
- **Response Time Improvement**: Measurable reduction in time between issue report and resolution
- **Support Cost Reduction**: Decreased technician dispatch requirements and associated operational expenses
