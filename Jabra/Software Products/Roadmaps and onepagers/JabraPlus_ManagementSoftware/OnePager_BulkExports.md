## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Point

_"We need to extract device and usage data from Jabra Plus to feed into our internal dashboards, compliance systems, or reporting toolsâ€”but there's no easy way to do this at scale."_

### Job to be Done

Enable IT admins to export device, user, and usage data in bulk from Jabra Plus for seamless integration with external systems, regulatory compliance, and strategic reporting workflows.

### Target User

IT administrators and business analysts in enterprise environments and managed service providers requiring large-scale data analysis and archival capabilities

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Limited export functionality creates critical business continuity gaps:

- **Manual Data Collection**: Teams resort to manual copying and screenshots, creating inefficiency and human error
- **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory requirements demand automated data extraction for audit trails and governance reporting
- **Business Intelligence Gaps**: Organizations cannot integrate meeting room analytics with broader workplace optimization strategies
- **Scalability Barriers**: Manual processes cannot support enterprise-scale data analysis and reporting needs
- **Integration Failures**: Existing enterprise systems cannot consume Jabra Plus data for comprehensive organizational insights

### Enterprise Context

Modern organizations operate data-driven decision-making processes:

- **Multi-System Integration**: Device data must feed into Power BI, ServiceNow, Tableau, and custom analytics platforms
- **Compliance Mandates**: Regulatory frameworks require comprehensive audit trails and usage reporting
- **Strategic Planning**: Workspace optimization depends on aggregated device utilization and performance metrics
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated data flows eliminate manual reporting overhead and reduce time-to-insight
