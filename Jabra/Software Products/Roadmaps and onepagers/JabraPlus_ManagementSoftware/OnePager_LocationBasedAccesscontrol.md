# Location-Based Access Control

## Executive Summary

Large enterprise customers require granular access control that allows IT administrators to manage only specific geographic locations or device groups, preventing unauthorized access across global deployments while maintaining centralized organizational oversight.

## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Point

_"I don't want the IT-A in New York to be able to see or manage the devices in Mumbai"_

### Job to be Done

Enable system owners to assign IT administrators location-specific access permissions, restricting visibility and management capabilities to designated device groups or geographic regions.

### Target User

IT administrators using the Jabra Plus Cloud Management Platform in large, geographically distributed organizations

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Current all-or-nothing access model creates significant enterprise limitations:

- **Security Risk**: Regional IT staff can access sensitive devices and data outside their jurisdiction
- **Compliance Violations**: Regulatory requirements often mandate geographic data and access restrictions
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Administrators see irrelevant devices, creating noise and confusion in management interfaces
- **Scalability Barriers**: Large organizations cannot practically deploy without granular access controls

### Current Workaround Limitations

The only available solution today involves multiple tenant accounts:

- **Data Fragmentation**: Eliminates ability to aggregate management and analytics across the full organization
- **Administrative Overhead**: Multiplies management complexity and increases operational costs
- **Limited Visibility**: Prevents enterprise-wide insights and centralized reporting
- **Integration Challenges**: Complicates integrations with enterprise systems and workflows

---

## Solution Framework

### Current State Constraints

Jabra Plus currently operates on binary access model:

- **Full Access**: Administrators can manage all organizational devices
- **No Access**: Complete exclusion from management capabilities
- **No Segmentation**: Cannot restrict visibility based on location, department, or device type

### Proposed Solution Architecture

**Core Components:**

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Create hierarchical permission system with location-specific assignments
2. **Geographic Segmentation**: Enable device grouping by location, region, or custom organizational structures
3. **Owner-Controlled Assignment**: System owners define and manage regional administrator permissions
4. **Granular Permissions**: Support read-only, device management, and full administrative roles within assigned locations

### Success Metrics

- **Access Precision**: IT administrators can only see and manage devices in their assigned locations
- **Administrative Flexibility**: System owners can easily assign and modify location-based permissions
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced noise and improved focus for regional administrators

## Implementation Considerations

### User Experience Requirements

- **Intuitive Assignment**: Clear interface for system owners to assign location-based permissions
- **Visual Clarity**: Administrators immediately understand their access scope and limitations
- **Seamless Navigation**: Location restrictions feel natural rather than restrictive
- **Permission Transparency**: Clear indication of what actions are permitted within assigned locations

### Technical Requirements

- **SSO Integration**: Potential linkage with Single Sign-On systems for automated role assignment
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient filtering to handle large device populations without performance degradation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of access and management activities by location
- **Migration Support**: Smooth transition path from current all-access model to location-based permissions

### Customer Validation

- **Direct Requests**: Two Aha tickets with customer engagement (SW-I-27: 1 vote, IDEAS-I-32: 5 votes)
- **Enterprise Escalation**: DHL escalation with Q3 expectation, currently planned for Q4 delivery
- **Market Demand**: Essential requirement for large enterprise customer acquisition and retention

### Competitive Analysis

- **Logitech Sync**: Comprehensive role system with six distinct roles (_Owner_, _Sync Admin_, _Device Admin_, _Device Manager_, _Read-Only_, _Installer_) and granular permissions across users, rooms, groups, devices, updates, insights, alerts, and support tickets
- **Neat Pulse**: Simplified two-tier approach with _Owner_ (full access) and _Admin_ (region-specific) roles, where regional admins cannot manage users or organization-wide settings

### Future Considerations

- **Enhanced Role Types**: Potential addition of read-only roles for auditing and monitoring purposes
- **Department-Based Access**: Extension beyond geographic to functional organizational structures
- **Temporary Permissions**: Time-limited access for contractors or temporary assignments

This solution transforms Jabra Plus from a centralized management tool into a scalable enterprise platform that respects organizational boundaries while maintaining the benefits of unified device management and analytics across the entire organization.
