# Email Alerts for Meeting Room Devices

## Executive Summary

IT administrators need proactive email notifications when meeting room device issues occur to prevent user complaints and maintain reliable conference room operations before problems impact productivity.

## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Point

_"I don't want to wait until users complain before I know something's wrong with our meeting room devices."_

### Job to be Done

Enable IT admins to receive automatic email alerts when device issues arise—such as disconnections, firmware inconsistencies, or performance degradation—so they can act before users are impacted.

### Target User

IT administrators using the Jabra Plus Cloud Management Platform (Enhanced and Enterprise tiers)

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Without proactive notifications, IT teams face three critical challenges:

- **Reactive Response Model**: Teams must constantly monitor dashboards or wait for user complaints
- **Delayed Issue Resolution**: Problems persist longer, compounding user frustration
- **Degraded Meeting Experience**: Unreliable devices reduce confidence in conference room technology

### Market Validation

- Explicitly requested by enterprise customers for proactive monitoring
- Documented in Jabra Plus Paywall Features and moved to product backlog
- Standard feature among competitive solutions (Neat Pulse, Logitech Sync, Poly Lens)

## Solution Framework

### Current State Limitations

Today's monitoring capabilities are:

- **Real-time only**: No historical trend analysis
- **Passive**: Requires active dashboard monitoring
- **Reactive**: Issues discovered after user impact

### Proposed Solution Architecture

**Core Components:**

1. **Monitoring Engine**: Leverage existing telemetry to track device health
2. **Alert Engine**: Send customizable email notifications for critical events
3. **Configuration Layer**: Enable threshold customization, recipient management, and muting capabilities
4. **Integration Options**: Optional ServiceNow integration for enterprise workflows

### Success Metrics

- **Response Time**: Reduce mean time to issue resolution
- **Proactive Detection**: Increase percentage of issues caught before user reports
- **Confidence**: Improve IT team confidence in device uptime and performance

## Implementation Considerations

### User Experience Requirements

- **Intuitive Configuration**: Simple alert setup and management interface
- **Flexible Delivery**: Batch versus real-time notification options
- **Smart Muting**: Ability to suppress alerts during maintenance windows or for specific rooms/locations

### Technical Requirements

- **Telemetry Assessment**: Audit existing data streams versus new instrumentation needs
- **Secure Delivery**: Ensure reliable and secure email notification delivery
- **Access Control**: Implement SSO and role-based access for alert management

### Competitive Landscape

- **Neat Pulse**: Comprehensive device monitoring with cloud dashboard alerting
- **Logitech Sync**: Email alerts with ServiceNow integration capabilities
- **Poly Lens**: Custom alert configuration with API extensibility

This solution positions Jabra Plus as a proactive management platform that prevents issues rather than simply reporting them after user impact.
