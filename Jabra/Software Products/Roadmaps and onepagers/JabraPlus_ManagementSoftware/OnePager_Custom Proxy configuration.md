# Proxy Configuration Support

## Executive Summary

Enterprise IT administrators require custom proxy configuration capabilities for Jabra Plus clients to ensure secure connectivity through corporate networks with strict firewall policies, enabling complete device management functionality without network restrictions.

---

## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Point

_"Our corporate network restricts outbound traffic, and we need to configure proxy settings to allow Jabra Plus to function securely and reliably."_

### Job to be Done

Allow IT admins to define custom proxy settings so Jabra Plus clients can securely connect to the cloud platform in environments with strict network controls.

### Target User

IT administrators in enterprises with managed networks and strict firewall or proxy policies

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Network connectivity failures create cascading operational issues:

- **Service Blocking**: Corporate firewalls prevent Jabra Plus clients from accessing required cloud services
- **Update Failures**: Devices cannot receive critical firmware updates or security patches
- **Telemetry Loss**: Incomplete data collection prevents effective device monitoring and management
- **Remote Management Breakdown**: IT teams lose ability to manage devices centrally

### Enterprise Reality

Many enterprise environments operate under strict security models:

- **Segmented Networks**: Applications often run on different proxy configurations
- **Outbound Restrictions**: Default deny policies require explicit allowlisting
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory frameworks mandate controlled internet access

---

## Solution Framework

### Current State Capabilities

Jabra Plus currently offers:

- **CLI Configuration**: Proxy settings configurable via command-line tools
- **File-based Setup**: Configuration files enable proxy definition
- **Network Controls**: Support for outbound port access and domain whitelisting

### Enhanced Solution Architecture

**Core Components:**

1. **Configuration Interface**: Unified CLI and GUI options for proxy setup
2. **Authentication Support**: Handle proxy servers requiring user credentials
3. **Connectivity Validation**: Built-in testing to verify cloud endpoint accessibility
4. **Runtime Application**: Secure storage and automatic application of proxy settings

### Success Metrics

- **Deployment Success**: Admins can configure proxy settings during initial deployment
- **Connection Reliability**: Devices maintain consistent connectivity through corporate firewalls
- **Operational Efficiency**: Zero manual intervention required post-deployment

## Implementation Considerations

### User Experience Requirements

- **Onboarding Integration**: Proxy configuration embedded in deployment workflow
- **Validation Tools**: Test connection functionality with real-time feedback
- **Error Handling**: Clear diagnostic messages and troubleshooting logs
- **Setup Simplicity**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal network expertise

### Technical Requirements

- **Protocol Support**: Comprehensive analysis needed for supported proxy types and protocols
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted credential storage with runtime decryption
- **Client Architecture**: New Kiteman-based client type (.NET foundation) with rapid PoC capability
- **Endpoint Validation**: Automated testing against all required Jabra cloud services

### Strategic Alignment

- **2025 Roadmap**: Explicitly included in Jabra Plus 2025 roadmap as on-premises readiness component
- **Enterprise Migration**: Active discussions with enterprise customers during migration planning
- **Market Positioning**: Essential for competing in highly regulated enterprise segments

### Competitive Landscape

- **Logitech Sync**: Integrated proxy configuration through MSI deployment packages
- **Poly Lens**: Proxy support via dedicated device management agents
- **Neat Pulse**: Basic proxy support with limited documentation and capabilities

This solution removes a critical barrier to enterprise adoption, positioning Jabra Plus as a enterprise-ready platform that seamlessly integrates with existing corporate security infrastructure while maintaining full functionality and performance.
