# Scheduled Device Reboots

## Executive Summary

IT administrators need automated, scheduled reboot capabilities for meeting room devices to ensure optimal performance through proactive maintenance without requiring manual intervention or disrupting active meetings.

---

## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Point

_"I want to be able to reboot devices at a scheduled time of day, so that I can ensure that devices are working properly"_

### Job to be Done

Enable IT admins to schedule automated reboots of meeting room devices during off-hours for preventive maintenance and troubleshooting.

### Target User

IT administrators using the Jabra Plus Cloud Management Platform

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Current reboot limitations create operational inefficiencies:

- **Manual Process**: Requires individual, one-by-one device reboots
- **Real-time Dependency**: IT admins must be actively using Jabra Plus during reboot execution
- **Reactive Maintenance**: No proactive approach to prevent minor issues from escalating
- **Resource Intensive**: Time-consuming process for managing multiple devices across locations

### Business Impact

Scheduled reboots address three critical needs:

- **Preventive Maintenance**: Regular reboots resolve minor software glitches before they impact users
- **Peace of Mind**: Automated maintenance reduces IT workload and ensures consistent device performance
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates need for manual intervention during business hours

---

## Solution Framework

### Current State Limitations

Today's reboot functionality offers:

- **Individual Device Control**: Only one device can be rebooted at a time
- **Manual Execution**: Requires active user presence in Jabra Plus interface
- **No Scheduling**: Cannot plan reboots during optimal maintenance windows

### Proposed Solution Architecture

**Core Capabilities:**

1. **Scheduling Engine**: Allow IT admins to set specific times and frequencies for device reboots
2. **Batch Operations**: Enable simultaneous reboots across multiple devices or device groups
3. **Smart Scheduling**: Integrate with calendar systems to avoid reboots during active meetings
4. **Usage Detection**: Prevent reboots when devices are actively in use

### Success Metrics

- **Automation Rate**: Percentage of reboots executed via scheduled automation versus manual intervention
- **Device Uptime**: Improved device reliability through proactive maintenance
- **IT Efficiency**: Reduced time spent on manual device management tasks

## Implementation Considerations

### User Experience Requirements

- **Intuitive Scheduling**: Simple interface for setting reboot times and frequencies
- **Batch Management**: Ability to schedule reboots for device groups, locations, or entire organizations
- **Calendar Integration**: Visual scheduling interface with conflict detection
- **Status Monitoring**: Clear visibility into scheduled and completed reboot activities

### Technical Requirements

- **Usage Detection**: Implement safeguards to prevent reboots during active device usage (reference Aha! Idea SWS-I-113)
- **Calendar Integration**: Connect with meeting room booking systems to avoid scheduling conflicts
- **Reliable Execution**: Ensure scheduled reboots execute successfully even during network fluctuations
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to cancel or modify scheduled reboots before execution

### Customer Validation

- **Direct Requests**: Two Aha tickets with customer votes (SW-I-27: 1 vote, IDEAS-I-32: 5 votes)
- **Enterprise Escalation**: DHL escalation expecting delivery in Q3, currently planned for Q4
- **Roadmap Alignment**: Feature already committed to product roadmap

### Competitive Analysis

- **Logitech Sync**: Comprehensive role-based access with granular permissions across users, rooms, groups, and devices
- **Neat Pulse**: Simplified two-tier role system (Owner and regional Admin) with location-based access control

This solution transforms Jabra Plus from a reactive management tool into a proactive maintenance platform, reducing IT workload while improving device reliability through automated preventive care.
