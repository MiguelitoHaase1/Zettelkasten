## Problem Definition

### Core Pain Point

_"We don't have visibility into how our meeting rooms are being used or how well our devices are performing over time."_

### Job to be Done

Provide IT admins with actionable real-time and historical analytics across Jabra video endpoints to optimize room usage, device uptime, and performance while supporting strategic facility and technology decisions.

### Target User

Facility Coordinators, IT decision-makers, and administrators using Jabra Plus Enhanced and Enterprise tiers who need comprehensive workspace optimization insights

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Problem Matters

Analytics blindness creates cascading organizational inefficiencies:

- **Investment Justification Gap**: IT teams cannot demonstrate ROI on meeting room technology investments without usage data
- **Resource Misallocation**: Underutilized rooms consume real estate costs while overbooked spaces create user frustration
- **Reactive Maintenance**: Performance issues go undetected until they impact user experience and productivity
- **Strategic Planning Limitations**: Facility decisions lack data foundation, leading to suboptimal workspace design and technology deployment

### Business Impact

Comprehensive analytics enable three critical organizational capabilities:

- **Operational Excellence**: Proactive device maintenance and performance optimization based on real usage patterns
- **Space Optimization**: Data-driven decisions about room allocation, sizing, and technology configuration
- **Strategic Planning**: Evidence-based facility investments and workspace evolution aligned with actual usage patterns
