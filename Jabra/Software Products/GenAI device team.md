In the [[GenAI device team]] or [[Front-line Workers]] product, it seems like it's been more of a study group than actually building things. [[Ovais]] might be a little bit of a primadonna and might not have given enough guidance to truly get to products. So there might be a case for changing things a bit on this one to make sure that we actually deliver something, not just a study group.
