The primary device for [[Front-line Workers]]. Focus on Retail (e.g., Bauhaus), where we want broad offering so can be used in several verticals. Starting with 'talk with co-worker' later AI.

Low-profile, easy to wear, but shouldn't be too obvious for the customer in retailer ('discreet'). Expect/hope for 20 hour talk-time batterylife.

Status: In between D0 and D1.
