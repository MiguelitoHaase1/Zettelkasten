There's another product in the making that they're doing discovery on now in connection with the [[Outcome driven innovation]] work of [[Rajat]]. [[Nisse]] has identified this remote UI work, especially where the [[IT Admins]] can take over for what's happening on the device or monitor for view in [[Videoconferencing]] room. That's work done with [[Jabra/People/John Hand]] and [[Jeppe]] from UX. There they will actually define custom outcomes and jobs to be done here in August to get working in that particular way.
