# R&D Symphony Orchestra Metaphor

## The Metaphor

[[Christophe|Christoph]] describes R&D as "a symphony orchestra where everyone needs to be in sync (and of course led by a conductor)."

## What This Reveals

### Christophe's Mental Model
- R&D needs central coordination
- One conductor (himself) directing all
- Perfect synchronization is the goal
- Individual creativity subordinate to harmony
- Predictable, rehearsed performance

### Implications
- Top-down control structure
- Limited autonomy for teams
- Emphasis on coordination over innovation
- Process over outcomes
- Following the score vs. improvisation

## Why This Matters

This metaphor explains:
- Strong attachment to [[SAFe]]
- Resistance to autonomous teams
- Focus on synchronization ceremonies
- Hierarchical decision-making
- Fear of decentralized approaches

## The Counter-Narrative

Software development is more like:
- **Jazz ensemble** - improvisation within structure
- **Startup ecosystem** - independent but aligned
- **Scientific labs** - autonomous exploration
- **Sports teams** - situational adaptation

## Strategic Response

When discussing transformation:
1. **Acknowledge** the need for some coordination
2. **Reframe** to "jazz ensemble" needing less rigid structure
3. **Emphasize** innovation over synchronization
4. **Demonstrate** success through pilot teams
5. **Show** how less coordination = more value

## Connection to SAFe

The symphony metaphor perfectly aligns with [[SAFe]]:
- PI Planning = rehearsals
- Release trains = synchronized sections
- Ceremonies = keeping tempo
- Roles = assigned instruments

## The Problem

Software innovation requires:
- Rapid experimentation
- Customer responsiveness
- Technical creativity
- Autonomous decisions

None of which fit the symphony model.
