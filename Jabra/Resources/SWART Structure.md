# SWART Structure

## What is SWART?

SWART (SoftWare ART) is the Agile Release Train where all Jabra software product managers and teams operate within the [[SAFe]] framework.

## Current Organization

"All products are part of the SWART... so they are all in one, which means about 10 teams in one ART with very diverse needs!"

### Team Distribution
- **3 teams** on Device Management ([[John Hand]])
- **2 teams** on End user ([[Mikkel]])
- **3 teams** on Partner facing ([[Nisse]])
- **2 teams** on Platforms (no PM assigned)

## The Problem

### Cognitive Overload
From [[Day 0 - Overall team learnings]]: "All our product managers are sitting in ONE ART!! ... Ridiculous cognitive load to be in the same ART!"

### Diverse Needs Not Met
- [[Jabra+]] (enterprise device management)
- [[Jabra Mobile]] (consumer mobile app)
- [[Developer Platform]] (APIs and SDKs)
- [[Panacast]] (video hardware/software)

All have fundamentally different:
- Release cycles
- Customer types
- Technical dependencies
- Market dynamics

## Why This Matters

The SWART structure:
- Forces artificial synchronization
- Creates unnecessary dependencies
- Limits team autonomy
- Increases coordination overhead
- Reduces speed to market

## Alternative Approaches

Per [[Transform Away from SAFe]], consider:
- Separate ARTs by business domain
- Independent product teams
- Platform teams vs. product teams
- [[Shape Up]] methodology for autonomy

## Impact on Product Managers

- Can't focus deeply on their domain
- Spend excessive time in ceremonies
- Limited customer interaction time
- Forced to align disparate roadmaps
