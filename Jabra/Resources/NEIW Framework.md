# NEIW Framework

## Overview

NEIW is the governance framework used by Jabra R&D, developed during a transformation in the Hearing Aid division led by [[Christophe|Christoph Schmid]].

## Origins

- Developed with McKinsey support
- First implemented in Hearing Aid division
- [[Christophe]] was Chief Product Officer (Product Management + R&D)
- Rolled out across all R&D (headsets, video, software)

## Relationship to SAFe

"I think this is an adaptation of [[SAFe's factory mindset]]" - [[Anders]]

Likely includes:
- Similar ceremonies and roles
- PI planning concepts
- Agile Release Trains
- Hierarchical coordination

## Support Structure

- Backed by "rather large 'Transformation'-team inside R&D"
- Institutionalized with dedicated resources
- Deep organizational embedding
- Formal change management

## Results

### The Good
- Improved from "really bad state" in Enterprise
- Better planning than before
- Improved delivery predictability
- Higher quality standards

### The Limitations
- "Not the right state for us long-term - especially not in SW"
- Heavyweight process
- Limits agility and innovation
- Creates coordination overhead

## Why It Persists

Strong defenders create [[SAFe Immune System]]:
- [[Christophe]] has institutional power
- Transformation team has vested interest
- Some genuine improvements made
- Change would be disruptive

## Strategic Implications

Understanding NEIW helps navigate:
- What can be changed vs. sacred cows
- How to frame improvements
- Where resistance will emerge
- Potential compromise positions
