# Software Root Causes

## Underlying Problems

The [[Software Symptoms]] stem from fundamental issues in how software is planned and developed at Jabra.

### 1. Constantly Changing Scope and Roadmap

#### What's Happening
- Priorities shift mid-development
- Features abandoned before completion
- No stable direction for teams
- Reactive to latest customer complaint

#### Why It Happens
- Lack of clear strategy
- Too many stakeholders with veto power
- No framework for saying "no"
- [[SAFe's factory mindset]] ceremonies without strategic clarity

### 2. Incomplete Feature Set

#### What's Happening
- Features shipped at 70% functionality
- Missing [[Table Stakes Features]]
- Integration gaps between products
- Poor user experience

#### Why It Happens
- Trying to do too much at once
- No clear definition of "done"

- Technical debt accumulation

## Deeper Root Causes

### Process Issues

## The Vicious Cycle

1. Incomplete features → Poor customer feedback
2. Poor feedback → Panic and scope change
3. Scope change → More incomplete features
4. Repeat until burning platform
