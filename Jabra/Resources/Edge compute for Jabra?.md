# Anders' Perspective on Edge Computing for Audio Hardware

**Core Thesis:** While [[Google]]'s [[AI Edge Gallery]] presents a compelling opportunity for audio hardware differentiation through on-device AI, the fundamental market dynamics currently favor cloud-based solutions due to existing licensing structures.

## Strategic Opportunity Assessment

The [[Edge Computing]] proposition centers on leveraging superior privacy and latency characteristics to establish dominance in the emerging [[Voice as Keyboard Business|voice-interface market]]. [[Google]]'s [[AI Edge Gallery]] provides the technical foundation to potentially leapfrog competitors by offering on-device AI processing capabilities that major [[Videoconferencing]] platforms cannot match through their cloud-centric architectures.

## Market Reality and Value Proposition Challenge

The primary obstacle lies in customer perception of AI features as "free" within existing enterprise software licensing models. [[Microsoft Teams]], [[Zoom]], and [[Google Meet]] bundle AI capabilities into their room licenses, creating a zero marginal cost perception among customers who are already purchasing these licenses for core functionality. This bundling strategy effectively commoditizes AI features from the customer's perspective.

## Economic Dynamics

The true value proposition of local processing currently accrues primarily to the software vendors ([[Microsoft Teams]], [[Zoom]], [[Google Meet]]) through reduced compute costs rather than to end customers. However, these three dominant players show limited interest in cost optimization through [[Edge Computing]], as their current cloud-based models align with their broader platform strategies and data collection objectives.

## First Principles Analysis

From a [[First Principle Thinking|first principles]] standpoint, the disconnect between technical superiority (privacy, latency) and market adoption stems from misaligned incentives. While [[Edge Computing]] offers genuine technical advantages, the economic incentive structure favors centralized processing for software vendors, and customers perceive minimal incremental value due to existing licensing arrangements.

The path forward requires either fundamentally changing the value perception among customers or identifying use cases where privacy and latency advantages translate into quantifiable business benefits that exceed the perceived "free" alternative.
