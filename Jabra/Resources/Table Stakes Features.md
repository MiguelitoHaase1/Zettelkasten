# Table Stakes Features

## Definition

Minimum viable features that every enterprise [[Videoconferencing]] solution must have to even be considered. Without these, deals are lost before real evaluation begins.

## The Must-Haves

### Security/Compliance
- Enterprise-grade encryption
- Compliance certifications (SOC2, HIPAA)
- Data residency options
- Regular security audits

### Platform Compatibility
- Certified for [[Microsoft Teams]]
- Certified for [[Zoom]]
- Works with other major platforms
- Plug-and-play simplicity

### IT Admin Basics
- Remote device management
- Firmware update capabilities
- Basic monitoring and alerts
- Bulk configuration

### Quality Fundamentals
- Reliable audio/video quality
- Echo cancellation
- Noise suppression
- Consistent performance

## The Trap

Focusing only on table stakes leads to:
- Commodity competition
- Price pressure
- No differentiation
- The [[Catch-up Trap]]

## Strategic Implication

Per [[Stop Feature Parity Chase]], we need:
1. **Quickly achieve** table stakes (not all of [[Logitech]]'s features)
2. **Then focus** on differentiation
3. **Communicate** that basics are covered
4. **Excel** at what makes us unique

## Common Mistake

Confusing "what [[Logitech]] has" with "what customers require":
- Many Logitech features aren't actually table stakes
- Some are nice-to-haves
- Others serve niche use cases

## Validation Approach

To identify true table stakes:
- Analyze lost deals - what was disqualifying?
- Study RFP requirements - what's mandatory?
- Interview buyers - what's non-negotiable?
- Separate needs from wants
