# Software Solutions

## Proposed Solutions

To address the [[Software Root Causes]] creating our [[Software Symptoms]], three key solutions are proposed:

### 1. Clear Problem Definition

"Clear way to capture and communicate problems we solve"

#### Implementation
- Adopt Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework
- Focus on customer [[Outcomes vs Outputs|outcomes]]
- Document specific use cases
- Create shared problem repository

#### Why This Helps
- Aligns team on "why" not just "what"
- Reduces scope creep
- Enables better prioritization
- Creates customer empathy

#### Tools/Methods
- [[Continuous Discovery]] practices
- Opportunity Solution Trees
- Customer journey mapping
- Regular user interviews

### 2. System Design Clarity

"Clearer way to make systems design choices"

#### Implementation
- Document architectural principles
- Create decision framework
- Establish design review process
- Build modular architecture

#### Why This Helps
- Reduces technical debt
- Faster development cycles
- Easier integration
- More predictable delivery

#### Connection to Strategy
- Supports [[Platform Agnostic AI Strategy]]
- Enables [[Edge AI vs Cloud AI]] choices
- Facilitates modular products

### 3. Early Product Input

"Capture product inputs much earlier (pre-D0/D1 before conceptualization)"

#### Current Problem
- Input comes after design started
- Requirements discovered during development
- Late customer feedback
- Rework and delays

#### New Approach
- Customer input before roadmap
- Validate problems before solutions
- Prototype before committing
- Continuous not periodic input

#### Implementation Steps
1. Establish discovery cadence
2. Create customer advisory boards
3. Run design partnerships
4. Measure problem validation

## Enabling Changes

These solutions require:
- Moving PMs closer to development
- Reducing [[SAFe]] ceremony overhead
- Empowering teams to talk to users
- Shifting to [[Outcomes vs Outputs]]

## Success Metrics

- Time from problem identification to solution
- Feature completion rate
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Rework/pivot frequency

## Related Concepts
