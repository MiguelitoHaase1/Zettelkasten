# Jabra Software is a ‘tale of 4 businesses’

Currently, the strategy seems to be:

- In defence-mode for professional headsets (not much of a software play)
- In offence-mode for video conferencing.
- Opportunistic approach to other opportunities, like front-line workers, voice as the new keyboard (GenAI), and Jabra Engage.

  

### Details about these businesses below:

1: Professional Headsets (85% of the business, 50% market share, low potential growth)

This is the ‘old’ incumbent business, where Jabra is market leader and highly skilled - among knowledge workers, we have a stronghold and product market fit. It’s our bread and butter, sometimes taken for granted. However, the prosumer is coming, so we really shouldn’t rest on the laurels. We’ll both need basic ‘device management’ for IT admins (Jabra+) and some exciting new user experiences to be the chosen device (e..g, Seamless GenAI access, Cognitive Health (e.g., focus)).

  

2: Video Conferencing (15% of the business, 5% market share, strong potential growth)

Logitech and Cisco are market leaders... [Neat.no](http://Neat.no) a fast mover. This is known as the ‘hail mary’ for Jabra’s growth, but hasn’t really gotten out of the starting blocks yet - we do not have product market fit.

We’ll need to i) define our positioning, and ii) define what should be the beachhead customer for that positioning, we can start winning immediately.

3: Front-line workers (0% of the business, huge TAM and potential growth)

This is known as a strong potential direction, adjacent to the professional headsets business. It could be powerful in select verticals (telehealth/healthcare, Banking, call desks, retail...). Ways to play it:

- - AI agent calls
    - GenAI help in your device
    - CRM integrations
    - Emotional analysis (Engage AI)

This one has very real potential to grow beyond Video Conferencing.

  

4: ‘Voice as the new keyboard’ (0% of the business, huge TAM and potential growth)

This is not currently a big focus, but could be in the future. It is a generalization of (3) but for knowledge worker. What if we could make it easier for employees to collaborate and share ideas, by having a ‘hive mind’ available on audio? An example: Embrace “Loom-ification” and make meetings redundant... (e.g., create an audio-visual setup for one person to do a professional Loom in the room with great transcription etc).

The potential of this one is huge as well. But largely unexplored.
