# SAFe Immune System

## Definition

The organizational antibodies that will resist attempts to move away from [[SAFe]] and [[NEIW Framework]] at Jabra.

## Key Defenders

### Christophe (R&D Leader)
- Implemented NEIW in Hearing Aid division
- Sees R&D as [[R&D Symphony Orchestra Metaphor|symphony orchestra]]
- Has institutional power
- Will "fight hard back against going SAFe"

### Cassie (Head of PMO)
- Owns the process implementation
- Career invested in current system
- Controls project management office
- Strong defender of status quo

### Transformation Team
- "Rather large" team inside R&D
- Jobs depend on maintaining framework
- Deep expertise in current system
- Natural resistance to change

## Resistance Triggers

What would cause immune response:
- Getting rid of [[Business Owners|BOs]]
- Eliminating [[Product Owners|POs]]
- Removing [[RTEs]]
- Cutting [[Scrum masters]]
- Elevating Product Managers
- Creating [[Tech Leads]] and [[Design Leads]]

## How They'll Fight

1. **Appeal to Past Success** - "We improved from really bad state"
2. **Risk Arguments** - "Change will cause chaos"
3. **Coordination Concerns** - "We need synchronization"
4. **Resource Arguments** - "We invested so much already"

## Counter-Forces

People feeling "we are on the wrong track":
- CEO [[Peter Karlstromer]]
- EVP Enterprise [[Calum MacDougall]]
- R&D leader of SW development center
- [[Anders]] (mandate to look with fresh eyes)

## Strategic Approach

Per [[SAFe Exit Strategy]]:
1. Don't attack directly
2. Make SAFe "boring" through tweaks
3. Demonstrate better results
4. Let success make overhead obvious
5. Then discuss reorganization

## Key Insight

"Getting such a leader in place will then make all the overhead roles redundant; and when that becomes obvious, then a re-org can be discussed."
