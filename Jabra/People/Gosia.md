Great design lead of the Digital UX team. Sociologist of training, so very focused on research (more than product).

She fights to get the UX'ers in earlier before Design/Develop phase --- into the Explore and Conceptualize phase.

I'd love for her to be even more ambitious on getting into the later phases ('Finalize heartbeat' and 'in-market'). I believe her job is to evolve the product teams to product operating model - not just avoid it by working earlier in the phases.

She really wanted a better overview of the roadmap/thoughts on next steps in the products.
