I had a chat with [[Nisse]] about his [[design]] organization. He has a team of four in an [[experience strategy team]] doing [[discovery]] basically: That's service designer in [[Jeppe]]. It's [[Thea]] who's been out quite a lot. It's [[Myrcelle]] who is quite young and sort of process optimizer type and [[Alessia]] who is a more classic research person. There is also one more person in the team which is the UX architect [[Dita]] she's a bit of a hacker and getting shit done or firefighter mode so she saw the fifth person in the team but doesn't really do discovery. Then there's what's called D-U-X or Digital UX team that has [[Gosia]] as the manager and then underneath, she has [[Gregorius]] who built the design system he's very blue in profiles almost anal. There's [[Sebastian]] who's in partnership into integrations (APIs/SDKs/MCPs,...), he has had a hard time deliver so far but it's only been there for like six months. There's [[Jennifer]] who's in video software art so that's a touch controller in the video conference equipment so product outside of the software art. There's [[Carolina]] who strong she's in sort of enterprise device management so she could be really powerful. In the team there, in the D-U-X team there is also [[Edgar]] there is [[Camilla]] who is young and talented and as [[Maria]] yeah so that's the full team.
