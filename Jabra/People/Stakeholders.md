Here's a list of more stakeholders to put into my people folder that are what I would call power brokers:

1. [[Christoph]] (head of R&D)
2. [[Jon]] (hardcore executor) - supposed to be really powerful. 
3. [[Bettina]] (Jon reports to) who's more of a discovery person, and something we can really influence. He apparently also knows [[Janne Jacobsen]] very well, so great influencer.
4. On video conferencing it's all about [[Olly]], his boss is called [[Holger]] but it's [[Olly]] that we can really convince he's more present, albeit extremely busy.
5. [[Rajat]] that we always need to be close to
6. [[Shahruja]] who's the boss of the POs, so that's an important stakeholder
7. [[Sanna]] who's the boss of [[Shahruja]] but also of all the developers so really important one
