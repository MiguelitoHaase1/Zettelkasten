## Core Discovery Principles

What's the cardinal rule of customer discovery? :: Focus on past behavior and specific examples, not hypothetical futures or what people say they would do
<!--SR:!2025-08-02,3,250-->

What makes a bad discovery question? :: Questions that are hypothetical ("Would you use...?"), leading ("Don't you think...?"), or solution-focused ("What features would you want?")

## Problem Discovery Questions


How do you get specific examples instead of generalizations? :: "Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem" followed by "Walk me through exactly what occurred"
<!--SR:!2025-08-01,2,249-->

How do you understand current workarounds? :: "How do you deal with this problem today?" or "Show me your current process for handling this"
<!--SR:!2025-08-03,4,270-->

## Advanced Techniques

What is the "Why Ladder" technique? :: Keep asking "Why is that important to you?" to dig past surface answers to emotional bedrock (usually 5 iterations)
<!--SR:!2025-08-01,2,249-->

What is a counterfactual question? :: "What would have to be different for you to love your current solution?" - reveals minimum viable improvements

## Procurement-Specific Questions

What tests if unique value beats feature lists? :: "Tell me about the last time you chose a vendor that had fewer features than the competition"
<!--SR:!2025-08-01,2,249-->

What reveals the procurement vs user gap? :: "When your IT Admins complain about a tool not meeting their needs, but it met all procurement requirements - what happens?"
<!--SR:!2025-07-31,1,230-->

## Follow-up Techniques

How do you validate cost/impact claims? :: Ask for specific metrics: "How much time exactly?", "What's the dollar amount?", "How many people are affected?"

## Conversation Flow

What should you focus on early in a conversation? :: Current state questions, their world (not your solution), specific past experiences to build trust
<!--SR:!2025-08-03,4,270-->

What belongs in the middle of a conversation? :: Dig into emotional signals, explore costs and consequences, map the four forces
<!--SR:!2025-07-31,1,229-->

How should you end a discovery conversation? :: Summarize what you heard, confirm priority of problems, test your understanding of their success vision
