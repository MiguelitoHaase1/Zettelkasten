# Week of 4th August 2025: Mapping Power and Building Coalitions

## Purpose This Week
This week, you'll map who actually has the power to change things and prepare a compelling deck to win them over. By Friday, you'll know exactly who can unlock change and have a story that motivates them to act.

## The One Key Problem to Solve
**Identify and map the real power brokers in Jabra, and have a deck ready describing your (4) key transformations to them**

- [[Transformation 1 - Nurture Deep Customer Sense in product teams]]
- [[Transformation 2 - Stop treating software like an afterthought]]
- [[Transformation 3 - Prove the power of Small Empowered Product Teams (Skunk works)]]
- [[Transformation 4 - Boost the use of AI in software development]]

Success looks like: Power broker map with influence levels + 10-slide deck tailored to their motivations, ready for next week's meetings (e.g., that links problems → transformations -> hypotheses → pilot programs).

## Key Questions to Ask Everyone
1. "Tell me about a time a big product change happened - who drove it and who had to say yes?"
2. "Who are the unofficial leaders that people actually follow, regardless of title?"
3. "Where is the feature parity chase most costly and speed reducing in [[Videoconferencing]]?"
4. "When's your next customer/user meeting I can join?"
5. "In one sentence, how would you describe the job of a product manager?"

## Five Other Potential Focus Areas for the Week

### 1. How to avoid the feature parity trap?
**Problem**: Currently, we are in a feature parity chase in [[Videoconferencing]]... we will never win that way, and have to change the narrative
**Action**: Go deep with [[John Hand]] on understanding the feature parity plan, and describe the cracks and opportunies. Get super tactical and propose that tio Anders
**Key People**: [[John Hand]], [[Anders]],[[Ollie]],...

### 2. Build the Case for Product Leadership
**Hypothesis**: PMs lack real agency - display clearly how much we lose from not having that
**Action**: Document 3 specific examples where lack of PM authority led to product failures/delays
**Key People**: [[Anders]], [[Rajat]], frustrated PMs,...

### 3. Design Skunk Works Operating Model
**Problem**: Need concrete "rules" that protect [[Front-line AI Skunk Works]] from organizational antibodies
**Action**: Draft 1-page "Skunk Works Charter" with 5-7 non-negotiable operating principles
**Key People**: [[Anders]], Ovais, Alex, anyone who's tried (and failed) to innovate - Jabra Engage?

## Success Metrics by Friday
- [ ] Power broker map identifying 5+ key influencers with their motivations
- [ ] 10-slide hypothesis deck reviewed and ready for power broker meetings
- [ ] Listen A LOT! Particularly to my team
- [ ] Potential: Describe the feature parity trap in detail, and align a way forward with John Hand and Anders
- [ ] Potential: Skunk Works Charter with 5-7 operating principles drafted
- [ ] Potential: Plan for increased customer engagement
- [ ] Potential: Write down my thoughts for AI-driven development teams

## Remember
Power brokers respond to what helps THEM win - frame every hypothesis through their lens, not yours.
