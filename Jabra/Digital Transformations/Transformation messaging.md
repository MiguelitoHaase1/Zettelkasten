These are just first thoughts on what messages to bring out in a transformation:

**It takes a village** - we need to evolve from individual heroes.

**Treating people like adults** - we need to evolve from mechanistic processes, artifacts, and rituals

**Compress cycles:**Â From quarterly to 6 weekly. Give space for more human judgement in compressing cycles on a case-by-case basis.

**Step on toes**: We need to get away from swim-lanes and 'you shouldn't talk about x'.
