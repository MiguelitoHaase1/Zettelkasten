# Transformation 3: Prove the power of Small Empowered Teams (Skunk Works)
**HOW we organize**

## The Transformation

Prove what small, autonomous skunk works teams can accomplish when freed from organizational constraints and given direct customer access.

## Key Initiatives

### Start pushing more decisions into product teams
- Across our SAFe rituals, make sure to nudge more and more decisions to be made where context is biggest - the product teams
- Build product-team specific rituals, rather than corporate-wide ones

### SWAT Team for Beach-head Customers in [[Videoconferencing]]]]
- Rapid response team for [[Videoconferencing]] beachhead customers
- 2-week turnaround on customer requests
- Direct line from customer to code
- See [[Working Backwards 2025 Goal Visualization]]

### Front-line AI Device Team
- Skunk works for [[Front-line Workers]] AI device
- Small team with end-to-end ownership
- Direct market experimentation
- Bypass traditional governance

## Why This Matters

Traditional large teams in [[SAFe]] frameworks:
- Move slowly due to coordination overhead
- Lose customer signal through layers
- Optimize for predictability over innovation
- Discourage risk-taking

Small empowered teams:
- Ship 10x faster
- Learn directly from customers
- Take calculated risks
- Build ownership mentality

## Success Metrics
- Time from idea to customer: <2 weeks
- Team size: <8 people
- Direct customer conversations: Weekly
- Experiments per week: 10+
- Autonomy score: Full P&L ownership

## Core Beliefs Alignment

This transformation embodies:
- [[10X Thinking]] - Small teams can achieve 10x impact through focus and autonomy
- [[Execution Rhythm]] - Compressed feedback cycles, "meet in 2 hours" not next week
- [[Scientist vs Factory Manager Mindset]] - Experimentation over predictable delivery
- [[Adaptive Strategy]] - Teams hold vision but adapt tactics based on learning
- [[DORA Metrics]] - Elite performance through small batch sizes and rapid deployment
- [[Trust as Vulnerability]] - Empowerment requires deep trust in teams
