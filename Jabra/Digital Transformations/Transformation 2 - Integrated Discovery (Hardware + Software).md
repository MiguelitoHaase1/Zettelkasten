# Transformation 2: Integrated Discovery (Hardware + Software)
**WHAT we build together**

## The Transformation

Break down the artificial walls between hardware and software development. Software is not an afterthought - it's the differentiator that makes hardware sing.

## Key Initiatives

### Unified Product Discovery
- Hardware and software teams in same discovery sessions
- Joint customer interviews from day one
- Shared OKRs and success metrics
- Combined roadmaps, not sequential handoffs

### BYOD Market Domination
- Win 50% of existing BYOD market in professional headsets
- Software-first approach to hardware features
- AI capabilities as core, not add-on
- Platform thinking from conception

### Software-Defined Devices
- Features delivered through software updates
- Hardware as platform for software innovation
- Continuous improvement post-purchase
- Subscription-ready capabilities

## Why This Matters

Current state problems:
- Software teams brought in after hardware decisions
- Feature parity focus instead of software differentiation
- Hardware constraints discovered too late
- Missed opportunities for software-enabled value

Integrated discovery enables:
- 10x better user experiences
- Software features that drive hardware sales
- Hardware designed for software flexibility
- Faster time-to-market for innovations

## Success Metrics
- Joint discovery sessions: 100% of new products
- Software features driving purchase: >50%
- Post-purchase feature delivery: Monthly
- Cross-functional team satisfaction: >8/10
- Time from concept to integrated prototype: <3 months

## Core Beliefs Alignment

This transformation embodies:
- [[Customer Discovery Principles]] - Both hardware and software teams hear customer needs directly
- [[Build vs Buy Decision]] - Build integrated experiences competitors can't match
- [[First Principle Thinking]] - Question why hardware and software are separate
- [[Jobs To Be Done]] - Customers hire products for outcomes, not hardware specs
- [[Strategic Kernel]] - Software differentiation as coherent action against commoditization
- [[The Scientific Method for Products]] - Test integrated prototypes, not separate components
