**Proposed new principles to adhere to in a transformation (particularly for empowered product teams):**

- **Move slow to move fast:** speed of iteration is more important than fast one-off
    
- **Path-aware decisions:** Early choices (architecture, vision,...) have lasting impact. So - we think things through... plan slow - move fast!
    
- **Compress cycles:** From quarterly to 6 weekly. Give space for more human judgement in compressing cycles on a case-by-case basis.
    
- **Create "no-fly zones":** In certain domains and areas, managers and BU should not engage.
    
- **Write it down:** Use asynchronous updates for status, synchronous for problem-solving

- **Not one size fits all**: Do a lean model of SAFe for many things - but use skunk works small teams for more innovative problems --- even use an external (like Sierra) for problems where we don't have to differentiate
