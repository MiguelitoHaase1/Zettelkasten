# Transformation 4: Boost the use AI in software development
**TOOLS we use**

## The Transformation

Re-organize, re-train, and re-tool product teams for a post-AI product world. Every team member becomes 10x more productive through AI augmentation.

## Key Initiatives

### AI-Powered Development
- [[Claude Code]] for every developer
- GitHub Copilot as standard
- AI-assisted code reviews
- Automated testing with AI

### AI Product Management
- Customer interview synthesis with AI
- Automated competitive analysis
- AI-powered user research
- Predictive analytics for feature success

### AI-First Products
- Voice AI as primary interface
- Predictive device management
- Intelligent meeting optimization
- Personalized audio experiences

### New Organizational Capabilities
- AI literacy training for all
- Prompt engineering as core skill
- AI ethics and governance framework
- Human-AI collaboration protocols

## Why This Matters

The AI revolution changes everything:
- Development velocity increases 10x
- Customer insights emerge from noise
- Personalization becomes table stakes
- Manual processes become obsolete

Organizations that don't adapt:
- Fall behind on velocity
- Miss emerging patterns
- Build yesterday's products
- Lose talent to AI-native companies

## Success Metrics
- Code written with AI assistance: >80%
- Time to prototype: 10x faster
- Customer insights per week: 100x increase
- AI feature adoption: >60% of users
- Team AI literacy: 100% trained

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Tool Adoption (Months 1-3)
- Deploy AI development tools
- Basic training for all teams
- Pilot AI features in products

### Phase 2: Process Revolution (Months 4-6)
- Redesign workflows around AI
- Advanced prompt engineering
- AI-powered decision making

### Phase 3: AI-Native Culture (Months 7-12)
- AI as default approach
- Custom AI tools for Jabra
- Industry-leading AI products
