### Stage 1: Optimize within the box
- **Fix PI planning** (Create clarity via the way we translate from roadmap->PI)
	- Define Epics not as bundles but actual 'opportunities' in an opportunity solution tree - that can be measured and called 'ready for dev' and 'done'.
	- Epic Owner-PO-PM-Tech Lead own epics and should be the ones presenting at NEIW rituals
	- Product and Engineering Leadership helps stack rank epics within NEIW rituals
	- We plug Epics into a roadmap (best man's best guess during NEIW rituals)
- **Install Metrics**: 
	- Dev: e.g., DORA (requires distinguishing deploy from release)
	- Cycle time: E.g., flow through NEIW stages
	- Business Outcomes (OKRs)
	- Sean Ellis score for each meeting/ritual
- Organize in **long-standing product teams** (use Team topology)
	- Platform team (integrates hardware-software + works on cross-tech (e.g., SSO))
	- Business Outcomes should define the teams topology, so they are long-standing
	- Spin-out ART rituals into smaller team sessions run by scrum masters rather than RTEs, so we reduce cognitive load (rule: Never more than 15 people in a ritual)
- Fewer, **better people in pivotal roles**
	- Simplify and concentrate a few people in a few pivotal positions (PM, Tech Lead, epic owners, RTEs...)

### Stage 2: Spin-out a few pilot teams (skunk works)
On a few topics (e.g., GenAI device, Agentification of IT Admin help), we spin out skunk works product teams, going through NEIW independently... more details to come.

### Stage 3: Change roles within SAFe
- Merge roles (PO-PM-epic owners) => Trios of PM-Tech Lead- Design Lead
- Smaller ARTs with less overhead roles
... more details to come.
