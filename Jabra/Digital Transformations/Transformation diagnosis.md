**Symptoms that we have a non-functional system:**

- **Waste:** In our existing rituals, 90% of conversations are irrelevant for 90% of people in the meeting room- this is wasteful, but even worse it's highly demotivating. On-top it seems like we align everything through meetings, rather than writing things up and visualizing, so we can communicate asynchronously.
    
- **Lack of agency:** 90% of individuals don't feel they can change much... so they hold back. To fill-in the vacuum, senior managers who are not fully in-context go deep and act/decide too much, accentuating the problem. At worst, we are creating a paternalistic culture where people become afraid to make judgement calls.
    
- **Business requirements are disconnected from Software reality:** PM/BUs push for features, while the team's ability to deliver goes to a halt due to rising tech debt --- PMs are too far away from code to understand the actual software reality.
    
- **Unclear what's ahead:** There is not a clear compelling vision behind our products, leading to very transactional/mercenary relationships between business and product teams and an unfit architecture... This also leads to a very small conviction in the concrete roadmap/plan.

- **People are spread too thin:** We are 116 software people across more than 40 products, so people are spread thin across. An improper team topology and no long-standing product teams means people are on cognitive overload - performance and quality is the victim.
    
- **Rituals create slow cadence:** Quarterly is good in hardware... but in software we need a faster cadence. We need to compress cycles (start with 6 weeks?) - and to make that possible have fewer stakeholders involved in each cycle. 

- **We are breaking**: Leaders take too much detail work on them - making them insufficient leaders. SWART team members have too much cognitive load.
