1. "External": Close the feature gap for [[Videoconferencing]]  software, faster.
    
2. "Internal": Build a kick-ass PM+UX team and help GN get to empowered product teams

My challenge:
Empowered product teams requires outcome thinking ... so I want to challenge the 'close feature gap' mindset
	Proposal: see [[Working Backwards 2025 Goal Visualization]]10% market share in [[Videoconferencing]] by 2030 -> proof PMF in 1 segment by 2026 -> Land 1 major client in promising segment('beachhead') in 2025 -> Have a client trust our promise to improve for them ("Cisco won't care about your segment like we do") ->Show how we work in real time - turn something around for them within 2 weeks -> Get a super small AI powered product SWAT team.
