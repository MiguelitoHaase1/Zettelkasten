1: We want a positive NPS!
2: Currently less then 1% use [[Jabra+]]... we want to reach >25% by April 2027.
3: Currently, 25% use legacy software like [[Jabra Direct]]/[[Jabra Xpress]]... needs to be 0% by April 2027. The high degree of legacy is largely the devices (11K are migrated, while 5mn are in Direct and 1mn in Xpress)
4: We want to have less than 75% of user systems be [[unmanaged]]
