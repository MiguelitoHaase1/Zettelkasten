For 2024-28, there is a 'where to play, how to win' framework-based strategy for Enterprise division (Callum's org) called "Making Work-Life better".

## Market context
### Customer
- Hybrid working and blending of work-life continues 
- IT budgets will continue to be pressured 
- IT decision makers will continue to prioritise ease of deployment, management & reliability for both headsets & video. Unlocking value of SW investments remains key. 
- Penetration of headsets & video will be lower in SMEs

### Competition
- PC vendors will challenge price & drive commoditisation in headsets while others will also compete on price and are expected to extend portfolio to compete 
- Video landscape is broad and competition is expected to compete at lower price points 
- FLW market is fragmented with no clear leader of digitized segment

### Industry trends
- Microsoft is winning the “UC” & rooms market while Zoom & Google remain important 
- AI, in all forms, is the future with particular focus on GenAI e.g., co-pilot to unlock productivity gains 
	- My challenge: Regarding AI - co-pilot seems irrelevant. Surely, it's winning on the surface, but people do 'bring your own AI' without telling anyone (Claude, GPT,...)
- Core audio capability continues to move to cloud

## Winning Aspiration
**Making work-life better**: The world needs better work - productivity gains are declining, and employees increasingly want empowered and flexible work- life experiences. As Jabra, we can help. Today, we improve millions of meetings and calls together with our ecosystem partners. Tomorrow, we can further enhance work-life through generative AI workflows allowing customers and end users to be more effective, flexible, and empowered.
