Software is expected to become more important for device sales due to GenAI and cybersecurity:
**GenAI**:
- Knowledge workers - can voice-driven workflows replace keyboard?
- Front-line workers - Can we replace PDA with IoT connected GenAI wearables?
- Meeting rooms - Can GenAI based management leapfrog competition?
**Cybersecurity**:
	- Secure platform via Penetration tests, E2E encryption, Data sharing controls...
	- Certifications and compliance via SOC2 compliance, ISO 70001certification, GDPR etc
	- GenAI cybersecurity via sensor-based auth, voice auth,...

for [[video conferencing]] software is essential, because a lot of the value is outside of the meeting itself (e..g, IT admins,)... the purpose of software here is to increase A/V device sales.

for [[professional headsets]], we have 20% market penetration, and a 1% increase is equivalent to 500mn DKK.
