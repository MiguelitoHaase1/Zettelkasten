[[Ovais]] supported my plan to have these rituals:
1 - weekly 1 hour 1-on-1's
2 - Friday zoom-outs
3 - Monthly planning (OKR study halls)
4 - Monthly problem solvings (defining epics better?)

Ovais has been shifting between product teams, and not consistently staying with individual teams - he was with Jabra+, was with Front Line Workers, and now he already says he wants to start up stuff on the MCP for the Jabra+ API to move on... we need long standing Product managers. What's behind all this?

Currently working on 3 things:
1 - GenAI for Jabra+ (MCP on-top of API to empower IT admins with GenAI)
2 - Consulting existing devices to implement GenAI in there
3 - Working on next gen devices to add GenAI (likely with glasses)... working with Microsoft on this - where they are supposed to do the software.
