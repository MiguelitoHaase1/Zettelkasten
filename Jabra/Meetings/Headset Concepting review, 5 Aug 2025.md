Purpose of 'concepting review': giving status on new early concepts for guidance... candidates for epics. Includes estimates of Story Points to see if there's capacity.

This one is for [[professional headsets]], driven by [[Anoop David]]

13 participants (so cost of meeting around 13K DKK)...

In the NIEW flow (Explore -> **Conceptualize** -> Design & Develop ->Finalize  Heartbeat -> In Market -> Discontinue).

First concept presented (by Hebe Jiang): TWS FW Platform ("True Wireless Stereo Firmware Platform."). Should operate Jabra's true wireless earbuds, enabling features such as audio playback, connectivity, battery management, and user controls. The team wanted resources/showing Story Point gap... but didn't ask for any guidance.

Thoughts on the 'concepting review': 13 people, and only a request for resources (Story Point gap) --- no ask for guidance... so superflous with so many people - or wrong people in there? Seems like only real purpose is to share context early... can be done in written form?
