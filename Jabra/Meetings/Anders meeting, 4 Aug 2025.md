For [[video conferencing]] its really software that’s the bottleneck for landing deals —- particularly the [[Jabra+]] capabilities for [[IT Admins]] to ensure uptime. 

One can solve for this bottleneck via i) UI experiences that match our competitors, ii) API’s/SDKs that make it easy for customers to have ‘[[one pane of glass]]’ to manage rooms across vendors (75% customers have a mix of Logitech, Polly, Cisco, )).

[[video conferencing]] players ‘say’ they really want the API - but in reality in short run most want the UI… Unless we could focus on the [[Beachhead customers]] who will work with APIs… and just nail that segment first?!

[[video conferencing]] key value prop for Jabra is i) small room 360 degree view (no one’s left out of frame),  ii) the trust/brand Jabra has among our customers via the headset space.
