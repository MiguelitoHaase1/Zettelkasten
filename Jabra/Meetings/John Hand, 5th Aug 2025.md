We talked about how Jabra+ is under a lot of pressure, focusing on (in prioritized order) ...
1: Add new devices (high commitment)
2: Fix most important escalations from in-market issues and Aha (high commitment)
3: Chasing "feature parity" (High priority)
4: Building PMF for API for 'single pane of glass' 
5: Other issues from Aha and in-market issues
6: Adding Service Tiers
7: Migrations from legacy systems - Xpress- by 2027
8: Front-line worker integrations

This is a really important issue--- as long as we have work coming from all these 8 directions, the team cannot focus - hence won't deliver quality... Ideally, we'd just get faster development speed and then all will be fine, but likely  this is not going to happen in short run. We need to address that:

Agreements:
I: We agreed to create a proper canonical document describing what we mean by 'feature parity' - what do we, and what don't we do?

Additional small ideas:
- (2) and (5) - Could the User lead (carolina) or designers cover the analysis of Aha and in-market issues?
- (6), (7), and (8) - Could we delay covering other issues (e.g., in Aha), Migrations, and front-line workers?  

Some more controversial ideas:
- (4) - Could the API/MCP/SDKs be done in a seperate product team? Is that best done by Allan? Any help from Ovais? [[Anders]]' view is that API is basically ready, albeit not very nice and commercial... and that we should just add a few bells and whistles and call it a day. I believe it requires a lot of real work to make an API good enough to reach PMF --- requires dedicated attention.
- (5) could we delay Service Tiers and just accept that we won't get that revenue source for a little longer?
