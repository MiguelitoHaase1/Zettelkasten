# Meeting: Design Strategy Discussion with [[Nisse]]
Date:: [[2025-08-01]]
Type:: #meeting/strategic
Project:: [[Design Organization]], [[Software-Hardware Integration]]

## Key Points

My meeting notes from my two hours with [[Nisse]]: First of all, we learned that his design team is split up between two parts:

1. [[Digital Design]] for [[Software Products]]
2. [[Product Design]] for [[Hardware]]

The [[Digital Design]] is what they took over from [[AnyOne consultancy]] and now it's more of an afterthought. Designers are involved, but it's not that exciting, and his [[Software needs to stop being an afterthought|software is an afterthought]] in [[Jabra]], which obviously needs to change for us to succeed. [[Nisse]]'s future view is that the [[Early Discovery]] that combines [[Hardware]] and [[Software]] into one mindset is the future. This old-school [[Software Development]] isn't really working, and as [[AI]] gets better, this kind of design with lipstick on the pick can be done much more efficiently with less people. Let's see for the design delivery function. He was very excited about the [[Early Discovery]] phase. On the other hand, they were discovery phases where we create real vision and really want to work combining [[Software]] and [[Hardware]]. The three areas he focused on particularly were:

1. **[[Knowledge Worker]] mapping**: There's a project going on about how they can use [[AI]] and more to understand how [[Knowledge Workers]] work post-[[COVID]] and [[Hybrid Work]] settings, really using [[AI]] well, and where the [[Headsets]] and [[Voice]] play a role.
2. **[[Interaction Interfaces]]**: How do we use [[Voice]] to navigate in interfaces? What can we even do with the cradle of the [[Jabra Headsets]] have navigation happening there?
3. **[[Integrations]]**: How to integrate with existing systems.

Those are the three areas to do [[Discovery]] in that he started projects on. Nothing about this is he had no strong views on [[Video Conferencing]] - he felt like he didn't know enough about that field. So that's another field.

It was [[Nisse]]'s view that we've been spending most of our time focusing resources on delivery of products rather than [[Discovery]], as a result we're not setting up the systems right (like [[AI Design Systems]]) to truly deliver fast. We're not optimizing the system, we're just optimizing for short-run delivery.

[[Nisse]] has a strong vision for really working in the [[Software]] and [[Hardware]] space in [[Discovery]] and going there.

## Decisions
- Focus shift needed from delivery to [[Discovery]]
- [[Software-Hardware Integration]] is critical for future success
- Three priority [[Discovery]] areas identified

## Action Items
- [ ] Follow up on [[Knowledge Worker]] mapping project status
- [ ] Explore [[Voice]] navigation possibilities for [[Interaction Interfaces]]
- [ ] Review [[Integrations]] opportunities with existing systems

## Questions Raised
- [[Open Questions#Video Conferencing Strategy]] - [[Nisse]] lacks expertise here
- [[Open Questions#AI Design Systems Implementation]]
- [[Open Questions#Resource Allocation Discovery vs Delivery]]

## Assumptions Surfaced
- [[Assumption: Software as afterthought limits success]]
- [[Assumption: Early Discovery Phase Critical]]
- [[Assumption: AI will automate basic design work]]
