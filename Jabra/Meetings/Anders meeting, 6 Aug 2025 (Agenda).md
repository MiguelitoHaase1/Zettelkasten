## Topics to discuss

### My team rituals
1 - weekly 1 hour 1-on-1's
2 - Friday zoom-outs
3 - Monthly planning (OKR study halls)
4 - Monthly problem solvings (defining epics better?)

### Ovais --- new doubts
Ovais has been shifting between product teams, and not consistently staying with individual teams - he was with Jabra+, was with Front Line Workers, and now he already says he wants to start up stuff on the MCP for the Jabra+ API to move on... we need long standing Product managers. What's behind all this?

=> I start believing in Skunk works --- want to meet my friend August?

## Cash for setup of videoconf in Poland?!
Should I ask Olly for it, or should we do it?!

## More power to DUX, Poland
Direct link to devs and POs. 
Can be the PM's extended arm

### Sierra.ai or similar agent champion to solve IT admin challenges for videoconferencing?
Since we just need to get up-to-par on IT admin - why don't we buy it in town? Particularly, how about we get Sierra to build agents on our API... providing feedback on our API and making a superior IT admin experience?

Sidekick: How about we do it WITH Logitech?!


## Power brokers
I'd like a list of the makers and shakers.
1. "Tell me about a time a big product change happened - who drove it and who had to say yes?"
2. "Who are the unofficial leaders that people actually follow, regardless of title?"

Candidates: 
1. [[Jon]] (hardcore executor) - supposed to be really powerful. 
2. [[Bettina]] (Jon reports to) who's more of a discovery person, and something we can really influence. He apparently also knows [[Janne Jacobsen]] very well, so great influencer.
3. On video conferencing it's all about [[Olly]], his boss is called [[Holger]] but it's [[Olly]] that we can really convince he's more present, albeit extremely busy.
4. [[Rajat]] that we always need to be close to
5. [[Shahruja]] who's the boss of the POs, so that's an important stakeholder
6. [[Sanna]] who's the boss of [[Shahruja]] but also of all the developers so really important one

## De-prioritizing John's 8 pulls
[[John Hand, 5th Aug 2025]]
... thoughts?

Deepdives: 
- Service tiers --- must be a radical simplification available ... CRM system setup
- API --- I believe it's either all-in or nothing on such products
