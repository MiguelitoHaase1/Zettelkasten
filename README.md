# Zettelkasten - Michael's Second Brain

A comprehensive knowledge management system built in Obsidian, serving as a "second brain" for capturing insights, connections, and strategic thinking during my journey at Jabra.

## Overview

This Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a networked thought repository designed to:
- Capture and interconnect knowledge about Jabra's software product ecosystem
- Track assumptions, hypotheses, and decisions throughout the onboarding process
- Build a competitive advantage through systematic knowledge management
- Surface non-obvious relationships between people, products, and strategies

## Philosophy

Following the pyramid principle: high-level conclusions supported by detailed evidence, with aggressive linking to create a densely connected knowledge graph.

## Key Features

### üîó Aggressive Linking Strategy
Every mention of a person, product, concept, or project becomes a bidirectional link using `[[double brackets]]`, creating a rich knowledge graph.

### üìù Atomic Notes
Complex topics are broken down into focused, single-concept notes for clarity and reusability.

### üéØ Assumption Tracking
Systematic documentation of beliefs, hypotheses, and unknowns with confidence levels and validation strategies.

### üîç Connection Discovery
Designed to surface non-obvious relationships between people, products, and strategic initiatives.

2. Link aggressively - when in doubt, link it
3. Extract atomic notes from complex discussions
4. Track all "I didn't know that" moments

### For Strategic Planning
1. Document decisions with context
2. Create hypotheses for strategies
3. Link strategies to responsible people
4. Track assumptions underlying plans

### For Knowledge Building
1. Connect people to products
2. Link products to market needs
3. Surface patterns across notes
4. Build comprehensive profiles

## Tools & Technologies

- **Obsidian**: Primary knowledge management platform
- **Markdown**: Universal note format
- **Git**: Version control for knowledge evolution
- **Claude.md**: AI-assisted note processing and linking

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open in Obsidian
3. Install recommended plugins (if any)
4. Start with [[Daily notes]] to capture observations
5. Use templates for consistent note structure
6. Review [[CLAUDE.md]] for AI assistance guidelines

## Contributing

This is a personal knowledge repository. However, the structure and methodology can be adapted for team knowledge management systems.

## Note

This vault represents a living, evolving understanding of Jabra's ecosystem. Links grow denser and insights compound over time. The true value emerges from the connections between notes, not just their individual content.
